## Software Testing
[COMS 4170](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/courses/com-s-4170/) is a rigorous course that delves into advanced methods of testing and quality assurance for software at both the undergraduate and graduate levels the Iowa State University. It is taught by Professor [Myra Cohen](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/myra-cohen).

### Overview

Rigorous study of software testing principles, methodologies, management strategies, and tools. Topics include coverage criteria; specification- and structure-based test design; integration, system, and regression testing; automated test generation; GUI testing; mutation and metamorphic testing; and test management.

### Learning Objectives:

- Design tests to meet realistic coverage criteria
- Apply standard software testing techniques and tools
- Gain hands-on experience with automation and at least one advanced testing method

My Role (**Computer Science Graduate Teaching Assistant**, Spring 2025)

- Assisted in delivering course content and reinforced core topics such as black-box and white-box testing, adequacy and coverage criteria, integration, and regression testing.
- Supported the design, grading, and feedback process for assignments and examinations.
- Provided one-on-one mentoring and technical guidance to help students strengthen their understanding of software reliability, testing tools, and debugging practices.

### Key Topics Covered:

- Principles and methodologies of software testing
