## Software Testing
[COMS 4170](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/courses/com-s-4170/) is a rigorous course that delves into advanced methods of testing and quality assurance for software at both the undergraduate and graduate levels the Iowa State University. It is taught by Professor [Myra Cohen](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/myra-cohen).


## Overview

This course provides a rigorous study of software testing principles, methodologies, management strategies, and tools.  
Topics include **coverage criteria**, **specification- and structure-based test design**, **integration**, **system and regression testing**, **automated test generation**, **GUI testing**, **mutation and metamorphic testing**, and **test management**.
