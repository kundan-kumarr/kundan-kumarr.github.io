## Database Management Systems

### Course Description

**COMS 3630** offers a comprehensive introduction to **database systems**, covering both theoretical foundations and practical implementation. Students explore various data models (relational, object-oriented, and semistructured), learn **query languages** such as SQL and NoSQL, and build full-stack applications that integrate modern database backends with web interfaces.

The course emphasizes database **design**, **optimization**, and **application development**, using tools like MySQL, MongoDB, and Neo4J.

- Entity-Relationship (ER) Modeling  
- Relational Model & Relational Algebra  
- SQL Programming and Constraints  
- NoSQL Systems (MongoDB, Neo4J)  
- Schema Normalization & Data Dependencies  
- Database Storage & Indexing  
- Cost Estimation & Query Optimization  
- Transaction Management & Concurrency Control  
- Web Application Integration using SQL APIs & ORMs

### My Role

<p style="color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.05em;">
Computer Science Graduate Teaching Assistant (Spring 2023)
</p>

As a **Teaching Assistant** for COMS 3630, I supported over 100 students in understanding key database concepts and building end-to-end data-driven applications. My responsibilities included:

- **Lab Instruction & Demonstrations:** Led weekly sessions on topics like SQL programming, ER modeling, and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Neo4J).
- **Project Mentorship:** Guided students through semester-long projects, helping them design schemas, write efficient queries, and integrate databases with web applications.
- **Technical Support:** Assisted students in implementing transactions, managing storage, and debugging issues related to query execution and performance.
- **Design Review & Grading:** Evaluated assignments and database design submissions, providing constructive feedback aligned with best practices.
- **Office Hours:** Offered one-on-one and group-based academic support on database internals, relational algebra, and query optimization strategies.


## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Design and implement relational databases using **ER modeling and normalization** techniques.  
- Develop database-driven applications using **SQL**, **APIs**, and **ORM frameworks**.  
- Work with **NoSQL systems** including document-based (MongoDB) and graph-based (Neo4J) databases.  
- Understand internal DBMS operations, including **query processing**, **transaction management**, and **storage optimization**.
