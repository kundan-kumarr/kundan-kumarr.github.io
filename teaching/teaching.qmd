As a Computer Science Graduate Teaching Assistant at Iowa State University with over five years of teaching experience, I focus on creating an comprehensive, engaging, and challenging learning environment that meets the different needs of students. My teaching approach emphasizes connecting theory with real-world practice, helping students turn basic computer science ideas into practical skills. I encourage hands-on learning through software development, user interface design, and database projects that build both technical skills and problem-solving abilities. By combining project-based tasks with personalized guidance, I aim to prepare students to face current challenges in the tech field with confidence and creativity. My goal is to help students be ready for jobs in technology and able to think of new ideas.

## Future Goals
I am dedicated to the continuous development of my teaching methods and curriculum design. My objectives consist of:

- Incorporating new AI and software development tools as tools for student learning.
- Creating interactive, experiential, and project-based learning environments that encourage students to be actively involved.
- Becoming a resource to the community of computer science education through the innovation of curricula, research, and guidance of other educators.
- Broadening the students' access to the computing field where they can tackle the challenges of the real world by using their theoretical knowledge.
