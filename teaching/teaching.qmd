As a Computer Science Graduate Teaching Assistant at Iowa State University with over five years of teaching experience, I focus on creating a comprehensive, engaging, and challenging learning environment that meets the diverse needs of students. My teaching approach emphasizes connecting theory with real-world practice, helping students turn core computer science concepts into practical skills. I encourage hands-on learning through software development, user interface design, and database projects that build both technical skills and problem-solving abilities. By combining project-based tasks with personalized guidance, I aim to prepare students to face current challenges in the tech field with confidence and creativity.

In addition to classroom and lab, I also create **online learning resources** that break down complex concepts into simple, digestible formats. These include YouTube tutorials, blog articles, and written notes or mini-books that summarize difficult topics into clear, practical explanations and master difficult concepts at their own pace.

## Future Goals
I am dedicated to the continuous development of my teaching methods and curriculum design. My objectives include:

- Incorporating new AI and software development tools as part of student learning, helping them engage with modern development and analysis workflows.
- Creating interactive, experiential, and project-based learning environments that encourage students to be actively involved and learn by building.
- Becoming a resource to the broader computer science education community through curriculum innovation, teaching-focused research, and mentorship of other educators.
- Broadening students' access to the computing field so they can confidently tackle real-world challenges using both their theoretical foundations and practical skills.
