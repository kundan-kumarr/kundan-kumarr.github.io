## User Interface Design

### Course Description

**COMS 3190** introduces students to the principles and practices of **user interface (UI)** and **user experience (UX)** design through a balance of theory and extensive hands-on development.  
The course covers **human-computer interaction (HCI)** concepts, **front-end and back-end technologies**, and the use of modern **frameworks and APIs** for developing web and Windows-based user interfaces.  

Students gain experience with:  
- UI design principles  
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- React, Node.js, and Express  
- Databases (MongoDB and MySQL)  
- UML modeling and event-driven architecture  
- Web and desktop-based client/server applications

Computer Science Graduate Teaching Assistant (Fall 2024)
</p>

As a Teaching Assistant for COMS 3190, I supported over **100 students** in learning **full-stack web development** principles within the context of UI/UX design. My responsibilities included:

- **Technical Instruction:** Led lab sessions and live demos on **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, and **Node.js**, focusing on responsive, accessible design.  
- **Project Mentorship:** Guided teams through **semester-long UI/UX projects**, helping with **front-end development**, **API design**, and **database integration**.  
- **Design & Modeling Support:** Assisted students in using **UML** for system modeling and behavioral analysis, including **use case** and **interaction diagrams**.  
- **Testing Assistance:** Supported **unit testing** and **UI testing** in JavaScript and assisted with **debugging web applications**.  
- **Code Review & Feedback:** Evaluated submissions and provided feedback on **usability**, **design consistency**, and **code efficiency**.  
- **Office Hours:** Offered individualized technical support and design mentoring to strengthen students’ understanding of **UI/UX best practices**.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

- Design and implement **interactive, accessible user interfaces**.  
- Apply principles of **HCI, UI design, UX testing**, and **event-driven architecture**.  
- Develop **responsive full-stack applications** using modern frameworks and tools.  
- Model system behavior using **UML and interaction diagrams**.  
- Test and deploy applications using **modern development environments** and **version control**.
