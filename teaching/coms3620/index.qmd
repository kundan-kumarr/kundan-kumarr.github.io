## COMS 3620 – Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

### Course Description

**COMS 3620** is a project-based course focused on **object-oriented requirements analysis and system design**. Students learn to apply **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** and **design patterns** to build robust and evolvable software systems. The course emphasizes teamwork, iterative development, and the communication of design decisions through technical documentation and presentations.

### My Role as Teaching Assistant

As a **Teaching Assistant** for COMS 3620, I provided critical support to students in both design and implementation phases of large-scale object-oriented projects. My contributions included:

- **UML & Design Mentorship:** Assisted students in modeling system requirements using UML (use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams).
- **Project Guidance:** Advised student teams during the full development cycle—from requirement analysis and domain modeling to implementation and testing.
- **Design Critique & Feedback:** Evaluated and gave feedback on design homeworks, helping students strengthen their reasoning with design principles and patterns.
- **Technical Assistance:** Supported Java implementation of OO designs, clarifying concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and class hierarchies.
- **Presentation Coaching:** Helped teams prepare and deliver clear, well-structured final project presentations and reports.

This role enhanced my skills in software architecture, peer instruction, and coaching students on both **technical correctness** and **design clarity**.

### Learning Outcomes

Upon completing the course, students are expected to:

- Analyze software system requirements and model problem domains  
- Design robust object-oriented systems using design principles and heuristics  
- Apply and justify the use of **design patterns**  
- Produce UML-based design documentation  
- Implement object-oriented solutions in **Java** using abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism  
- Present and explain team design decisions in written and oral formats  
- Collaborate effectively in team-based development projects
