## Object-Oriented Analysis and Design

### Course Description

**COMS 3620** is a **project-based course** focused on **object-oriented requirements analysis and system design**.  
Students learn to apply **Unified Modeling Language (UML)** and **design patterns** to develop robust, scalable, and maintainable software systems.  

The course emphasizes **teamwork**, **iterative development**, and **effective communication of design decisions** through documentation and presentations.

### My Role

<p style="color:#1E90FF; font-weight:bold; font-size:1.05em;">
Computer Science Graduate Teaching Assistant (Fall 2024)
</p>

As a Teaching Assistant for COMS 3620, I provided end-to-end guidance to students through both the design and implementation phases of **large-scale object-oriented projects**. My contributions included:


- **UML & Design Mentorship:** Assisted students in modeling system requirements using UML (use case diagrams, class diagrams, sequence diagrams).
- **Project Guidance:** Advised student teams during the full development cycle—from requirement analysis and domain modeling to implementation and testing.
- **Design Critique & Feedback:** Evaluated and gave feedback on design homeworks, helping students strengthen their reasoning with design principles and patterns.
- **Technical Assistance:** Supported Java implementation of OOPS designs, clarifying concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and class hierarchies.
- **Presentation Coaching:** Helped teams prepare and deliver clear, well-structured final project presentations and reports.

This experience strengthened my expertise in **software architecture**, **model-driven design**, and **pedagogical mentoring** for complex system development.



## Learning Outcomes

Upon completing the course, students will be able to:

- Analyze software requirements and model problem domains using UML.  
- Design robust object-oriented architectures following proven design principles.  
- Apply and justify the use of **design patterns** in software construction.  
- Produce UML-based design documentation and diagrams.  
- Implement OOPS designs in **Java** using inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism.  
- Communicate and defend design decisions through written and oral presentations.  
- Collaborate effectively in **team-based development environments**.
