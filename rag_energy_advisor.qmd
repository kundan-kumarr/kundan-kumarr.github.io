The **RAG-Enhanced Energy Advisor** explores how **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** frameworks can improve decision-making and control strategies in **energy management systems** — while also examining their potential **security vulnerabilities**.

This project simulates a scenario where an attacker attempts to **trick an LLM** into generating **inappropriate or unsafe outputs**, such as fabricated or misleading control actions, or even **false medical diagnostics** within smart building health-energy systems.  
The system aims to demonstrate **defensive prompting, retrieval filtering, and trust calibration** mechanisms to ensure that LLM-based advisory systems remain **robust, interpretable, and safe**.

---

### Research Context
- Integrates **RAG pipelines** for real-time adaptive learning in multi-building environments.  
- Examines **prompt-injection attacks** that can mislead models into unsafe or irrelevant outputs.  
- Introduces **trust-aware retrieval weighting** to dynamically filter retrieved documents based on domain relevance and safety metrics.

---

### Core Technologies
- **LangChain** for retrieval orchestration  
- **FAISS / ChromaDB** for vector-based semantic search  
- **OpenAI GPT / Llama 3** as the base reasoning model  
- **CityLearn environment** for multi-building simulation and energy optimization  

---

### Key Insights
The project highlights the **dual nature of RAG systems** — powerful for enhancing reasoning and grounding, yet susceptible to **data poisoning and adversarial instructions**.  
By incorporating **safety filters** and **reinforcement-based trust weighting**, this framework helps move toward **secure, reliable LLM-driven control** in energy and cyber-physical systems.
