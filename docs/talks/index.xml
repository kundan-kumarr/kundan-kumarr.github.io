<p>As renewable energy sources become more integrated into the power grid, efficient scheduling of household energy consumption is essential to reduce costs and carbon footprint. In this paper, we introduce an energy optimization framework that optimizes the timing of appliance use based on dynamic carbon intensity and electricity prices. We determine optimal operation schedules using a multi-objective optimization model with a Gurobi solver and machine learning. We combine Random Forest and XGBoost for demand prediction, incorporating their uncertainty estimates into the optimization constraints. The model optimizes ON/OFF appliance schedules while considering constraints like minimum operating times and power balance. It shifts usage to lower-cost and carbon-intensity periods, which helps to reduce energy consumption.</p>
<p>Key contributions include ML-based demand predictions and mixed-integer programming (MIP) optimization that improves robustness to prediction errors while adjusting schedules based on time-of-use pricing and carbon intensity. Our smart scheduling and load shifting achieve a 35.8% reduction in costs, a 38.6% decrease in carbon emissions, and a 25.8% reduction in peak demand using a carbon-aware scheduling algorithm. This framework effectively shifts loads to low-cost, low-carbon times, offering significant economic and environmental benefits for residential energy management without compromising user comfort.</p>

## About the topic

The 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.

This year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the 'sticky notes' help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately.

  <title>Scaling Smart Grids with Transfer Learning and DRL</title>

<section id="introduction" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>As renewable energy integration accelerates, modern power grids face mounting complexity in maintaining stability and efficiency. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique for <strong>Volt-Var Control (VVC)</strong> — regulating voltage levels across the distribution grid — but its Achilles’ heel lies in <strong>expensive retraining</strong>.<br>
Every new grid topology or environment demands retraining from scratch, costing time, data, and computational energy.</p>
<p>In our latest work, presented at the <em>Workshop on Autonomous Energy Systems (GRID-EDGE 2025)</em>, we introduce a <strong>Transfer Learning (TL)-based DRL framework</strong> that enables policy reuse across different grid configurations — cutting training time by <em>98.14%</em> while improving performance by <em>69.51%</em>.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="core-idea-transfer-learning-meets-drl" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="core-idea-transfer-learning-meets-drl">Core Idea: Transfer Learning Meets DRL</h2>
<p>Traditional DRL systems learn from scratch. TL-DRL systems, however, <strong>transfer policy knowledge</strong> from a source grid (e.g., IEEE-123 Bus) to a target grid (e.g., IEEE-13 Bus).</p>
<p><img src="https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/talks/pes_gm_2025/image_talk_20220616.png" class="img-fluid" style="width:60.0%"></p>
<p>This approach allows agents to <strong>start smarter</strong>, building upon previously learned representations rather than reinventing them. The heart of this system is a <strong>policy reuse classifier</strong>, a small neural network that decides when the previously learned policy should be reused or adapted.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="how-it-works" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="how-it-works">How It Works</h2>
<p>The framework operates in three phases:</p>
<section id="source-training" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="source-training">1. <strong>Source Training</strong></h3>
<p>A DRL agent, using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, learns to manage the IEEE-123 Bus system. The policy parameters, denoted as θₛₒᵤᵣcₑ, optimize voltage levels and reactive power flow according to ANSI C84.1-2020 voltage standards.</p>
</section>
<section id="policy-reuse-classifier" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="policy-reuse-classifier">2. <strong>Policy Reuse Classifier</strong></h3>
<p>We train a binary classifier that predicts the probability of reusing a learned policy: [ P(|) = (f_()) ] If this probability exceeds 0.5, the source policy is transferred directly; otherwise, the agent retrains in the target environment.</p>
</section>
<section id="target-adaptation" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="target-adaptation">3. <strong>Target Adaptation</strong></h3>
<p>The target model (θₜₐᵣgₑₜ) adapts to the IEEE-13 Bus through <strong>fine-tuning and Q-value updates</strong>, balancing exploration and exploitation dynamically: [ = P(|) ] This adaptive mechanism allows the agent to decide when to trust previous experience and when to explore new strategies.</p>
<hr>
</section>
</section>
<section id="experimental-setup" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="experimental-setup">Experimental Setup</h2>
<p>We implemented the system in <strong>OpenDSS</strong> using the <strong>PowerGym</strong> RL environment.<br>
The source policy (IEEE-123 Bus) was trained for 20,000 iterations, taking 313 seconds.<br>
The TL-enhanced target model (IEEE-13 Bus) adapted in just <strong>9.6 seconds</strong> — compared to <strong>518 seconds</strong> when trained from scratch.</p>
<table class="caption-top table">

<p>These results show that TL not only speeds up convergence but also produces a <strong>statistically significant performance improvement</strong>.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-insights">Key Insights</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Efficiency Leap</strong> — TL cut training time by 98%, accelerating grid simulation workflows dramatically.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Policy Robustness</strong> — The classifier effectively distinguished when to reuse policies, preserving stability in unseen grid configurations.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Scalability</strong> — The approach generalizes across systems of different complexity, paving the way for large-scale adaptive control.</li>
</ol>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="broader-impact" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="broader-impact">Broader Impact</h2>
<p>The proposed <strong>TL-DRL framework</strong> makes reinforcement learning practical for real-world grid management.<br>
By leveraging existing knowledge, utilities can deploy <strong>smarter and faster control policies</strong>, reducing both <strong>operational costs</strong> and <strong>computational footprints</strong> — a critical step toward <strong>sustainable AI-driven power systems</strong>.</p>
<hr>
</section>
<section id="whats-next" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="whats-next">What’s Next</h2>
<p>Our next goal is to <strong>scale TL across multiple grid sizes</strong> — from micro-grids to regional networks — and to integrate <strong>physics-informed constraints</strong> that further improve generalization.<br>
We also aim to extend this framework to <strong>federated and collaborative learning</strong> paradigms, allowing distributed grids to share intelligence securely.</p>

## About the topic

The Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.

Since 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education. 

In this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!

## About the topic

Situational awareness is key to fast response during a public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic. However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.

Every day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.

Grab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!
