    "text": "Unlocking Advanced AI: Prompting for LLM Reasoning and Planning\nAre you ready to unlock the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and elevate your interaction with artificial intelligence? This learning path is designed to equip you with powerful prompting techniques essential for building sophisticated AI agents. Mastering these skills allows you to guide LLMs through complex, multi-step tasks, improving the accuracy, relevance, and utility of their outputs for real-world applications.\nLarge Language Models have created a new computing paradigm largely based on how we write prompts. This learning journey is focused on how advanced prompting techniques enable AI applications to become AI agents. By the end of the journey, you’ll understand the mechanics and possess the skills to apply prompting techniques to agentic AI systems. The Need for Agentic AI: Debugging Complex Code\nImagine you’re tasked with building an automated system to help developers debug complex code. Simply feeding the buggy code and the error message into a standard LLM often results in generic suggestions that miss the specific context of the larger project. The LLM might suggest superficial fixes or even introduce new bugs.\nHow can you create an AI assistant that acts more like an experienced senior developer – one that can break down the problem, hypothesize potential causes, decide which parts of the code to inspect, integrate information from different files, update tests, and even learn from its failures? This requires moving beyond single-shot prompts to build a system capable of multi-step reasoning, planning, and execution – precisely the prompting techniques we’ll master.\nWhy is a single, simple prompt often insufficient for guiding an LLM through a complex or multi-step task? Correct! A single prompt is like giving a single instruction, whereas complex tasks require an ongoing dialogue. To act like an “experienced senior developer,” the AI needs to be guided through a process of breaking down the problem, investigating, and integrating information—steps that require a sequence of prompts to manage the plan and its execution effectively.\nThink about a complex, multi-step project you’ve recently worked on, either personally or professionally. This could be anything from planning a detailed event, to troubleshooting a tricky problem at home or work, or even tackling a challenging creative endeavor.\nFoundational Understanding of LLMs: You should know what a Large Language Model (LLM) is at a conceptual level, including its general capabilities (e.g., text generation, understanding) and the basic idea of using “prompts” to interact with it.\nBriefly describe the project and list 3-4 distinct steps you had to take to move it forward.\nNow, imagine you were trying to get a standard AI assistant (like a basic chatbot) to complete the entire project for you using only a single request or prompt.\nBased on your experience with AI, at which specific step do you predict the AI would most likely fail, misunderstand, or give a generic, unhelpful response? Why do you think that particular step would be the breaking point for a single-prompt approach?\n\nprobabilistic In the context of interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM), what is a ‘prompt’?\n\nThe input text or instructions probide to guide its response Large Language Model (LLM)? A ML model trained on the vast amounts of text data to understand, sumamrize , generate and predict context\nThroughout this course, you’ll explore:\nThe world of AI Agents, understanding their core components and how they reason, plan, and interact with their digital environments.\n\nThe art and science of advanced prompting techniques, mastering how to instruct LLMs with precision and nuance.\n\nCrafting specialized personas using role-based prompting to make AI outputs more targeted and contextually relevant.\n\nUnlocking problem-solving abilities using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to guide the LLM's reasoning process and ReAct (Reason + Act) to enable LLMs to use tools and take actions.\n\nThe process of prompt instruction refinement, learning to systematically analyze and adjust your prompts for optimal performance.\n\nBuilding multi-step agentic workflows by chaining prompts together, allowing AI to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nPrompt Chaining & Feedback Loops: Building robust, multi-step workflows that allow an AI to tackle complex tasks and even improve its own work based on feedback.\nEnd of Course Project: Agentsville Trip Planner\nAt the end of the course, you’ll attempt to build the “Agentsville Trip Planner Assistant” project, a smart agent that can take a complex request and see it through to completion. This is your opportunity to see just how powerful prompting can be in agentic AI. You will apply all of the individual skills you learned to create a truly capable system.\nWe want to wish you the very best of luck! You’re about to start a journey to harness the incredible power of Large Language Models. Get ready to move beyond basic interactions and learn how to architect and guide AI.\nBy the end of this journey, you will have acquired the skills to:\nExplain AI systems that utilize LLMs for sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities.\nMaster a range of advanced prompting strategies to elicit precise behavior and information from LLMs.\nSystematically optimize and refine your prompts, transforming general AI responses into highly specific and useful outputs.\nConstruct multi-step AI workflows that can handle complex, real-world challenges.\nImplement mechanisms for validation and iterative improvement, leading to more reliable AI agents.\nUltimately, transform generic Large Language Models into specialized, powerful tools tailored to solve intricate problems across various domains.\nThis course will both challenge you and equip you with the cutting-edge skills needed to innovate in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. We’re excited to see what you’ll learn and, eventually, what you’ll build. Good luck!"

    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.\nIn this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on ‘how’ to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe high penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the grid introduces complexity to the operation and optimization of energy. One potential solution to the challenge is to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based techniques to regulate voltage and reactive power under dynamic conditions. However, there is a need to optimize the DRL for better performance and robustness. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization (BO) technique within the DRL framework to improve the performance and robustness of volt-var control (VVC) in power distribution systems. We combine the actor-critic DRL algorithm with the BO framework to yield fast optimal volt-var control policies. We use BO techniques to estimate DRL-based VVC decisions and accelerate model-training convergence. In the case study, we demonstrated that the BO in DRL on IEEE-13 has improved decision-making by 21.11% and 81.81% for 123 bus test systems. Our research shows that Bayesian-enabled DRL adapts to different grid configurations and maintains voltage profiles within desired limits, thereby improving DRL control policies."

We used a conversion of sensors-to-image, which enables us to take advantage of Computer Vision architectures and training processes. In addition to this data preparation methodology, we explore using state-of-the-art architectures to generate regression outputs to predict agricultural crop continuous yield information. Finally, we compare with some top models reported in MLCAS2021. We found that using a straightforward training process, we were able to accomplish an MAE of 4.394, RMSE of 5.945, and R2 of 0.861."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAs renewable energy sources become more integrated into the power grid, efficient scheduling of household energy consumption is essential to reduce costs and carbon footprint. In this paper, we introduce an energy optimization framework that optimizes the timing of appliance use based on dynamic carbon intensity and electricity prices. We determine optimal operation schedules using a multi-objective optimization model with a Gurobi solver and machine learning. We combine Random Forest and XGBoost for demand prediction, incorporating their uncertainty estimates into the optimization constraints. The model optimizes ON/OFF appliance schedules while considering constraints like minimum operating times and power balance. It shifts usage to lower-cost and carbon-intensity periods, which helps to reduce energy consumption.\nKey contributions include ML-based demand predictions and mixed-integer programming (MIP) optimization that improves robustness to prediction errors while adjusting schedules based on time-of-use pricing and carbon intensity. Our smart scheduling and load shifting achieve a 35.8% reduction in costs, a 38.6% decrease in carbon emissions, and a 25.8% reduction in peak demand using a carbon-aware scheduling algorithm. This framework effectively shifts loads to low-cost, low-carbon times, offering significant economic and environmental benefits for residential energy management without compromising user comfort."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntegrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into a power system requires more advanced control mechanisms. One of the control strategies used for Volt-VAR control (VVC) is to manage voltage and reactive power. With the increase in the complexity of the power system, there is a need to develop an autonomous and robust control mechanism using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enhance grid performance and adjust voltage and reactive power settings. These adjustments minimize losses and enhance voltage stability in the grid. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to develop a DRL-based VVC framework and mitigation techniques to protect against stealthy white-box attacks targeting the trained control policies of the DRL model. The mitigation technique on the trained DRL is proposed to control the voltage violations on the smart grid to enhance the stability of the grid and minimize voltage irregularities. Our proposed mitigation technique provided better control policies for DRL-based VVC, successfully mitigating 100 percent of voltage violations in the smart grid environment. The results show that the mitigation technique enhances the security and robustness of trained DRL VVC agents."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe integration of renewable energy resources has made power system management increasingly complex. DRL is a potential solution to optimize power system operations, but it requires significant time and resources during training. The control policies developed using DRL are specific to a single grid and require retraining from scratch for other grids. Training the DRL model from scratch is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel TL with a DRL framework to optimize VV C across different grids. This framework significantly reduces training time and improves VVC control performance by fine-tuning pre-trained DRL models for various grids. We developed a policy reuse classifier that transfers the knowledge from the IEEE-123 Bus system to the IEEE-13 Bus system. We performed an impact analysis to determine the effectiveness of TL. Our results show that TL improves the VVC control policy by 69.51 %, achieves faster convergence, and reduces the training time by 98.14%."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEffective human-machine collaboration can significantly improve many learning and planning strategies for information gathering via fusion of ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ data originating from machine and human sensors, respectively. However, gathering the most informative data from human sensors without task overloading remains a critical technical challenge. In this context, Value of Information (VOI) is a crucial decision- theoretic metric for scheduling interaction with human sensors. We present a new Deep Learning based VOI estimation framework that can be used to schedule collaborative human-machine sensing with efficient online inference and minimal policy hand-tuning. Supervised learning is used to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract hierarchical features from ‘images’ of belief spaces obtained via data fusion. These features can be associated with soft data query choices to reliably compute VOI for human interaction. The CNN framework is described in detail, and a performance comparison to a feature- based POMDP scheduling policy is provided. The practical feasibility of our method is also demonstrated on a mobile robotic search problem with language-based semantic human sensor inputs."

    "title": "Bayesian-Optimized Bidirectional Long-Short-Term Memory network for Wind Power Forecasting with Uncertainty Quantification",
    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjective\nWind energy technologies, including advanced management and scheduling, rely on accurate wind power forecasting (WPF) for optimal operation. Enhancing forecast precision is crucial for reducing volatility in wind power and improving forecasting reliability. While forecasting methods estimate future values from historical data, traditional approaches often struggle with computational efficiency and model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting model that integrates multi- variate estimation (MVE) and pure prediction (TSP) using a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (Bi- LSTM) optimized with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)- based Bayesian optimization. The model incorporates numerical weather prediction (NWP) data for real-time forecasting, a key limitation in existing methods. MVE utilizes features such as wind speed, direction, temperature, and pressure, while TSP captures historical power generation patterns. The TPE-optimized Bi-LSTM architecture effectively captures bidirectional temporal dependencies, improving in both short-term and long-term forecasting. The model is evaluated using a six-year historical wind energy dataset from NREL, with performance assessed through RMSE, MAE, and R2 score. It outperforms traditional LSTM variants (Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-LSTM) and state-of-the-art models such as Transformers and GRUs, achieving R² scores of 0.976 for MVE and 0.932, 0.928, and 0.864 for TSP across short-term, day- ahead, and long-term forecasting, respectively. Additionally, TPE based Bayesian optimization reduces computational time around 8-10%, enhancing hyperparameter tuning efficiency. The study further analyzes the model’s computational burden, scalability, and practical implementation, offering a robust and efficient approach for improving wind power forecasting accuracy. \n\n\nMethod\n(\\(N_{ASD}=23\\), \\(N_{NT}=52\\))\n\n\nResults\n\n\nConclusions"

Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

Target Adaptation\nThe target model (θₜₐᵣgₑₜ) adapts to the IEEE-13 Bus through fine-tuning and Q-value updates, balancing exploration and exploitation dynamically: [ = P(|) ] This adaptive mechanism allows the agent to decide when to trust previous experience and when to explore new strategies."

It is now capable of analyzing medical images, guiding transportation, filtering online information, and increasingly operating within cyber-physical systems (CPS) such as smart energy systems, hospitals, transportation networks, and industrial plants. Ensuring the safety of these systems is one of the main challenges in modern AI and control engineering.\nThese systems integrate software and physical processes, making failures in artificial intelligence (AI) significantly more consequential. AI is increasingly becoming a vital part of our world. At the core of this issue are two key concepts: AI safety and AI alignment.\nCurrently, two concepts are central to the responsible deployment of AI:\nWhile safety aims to prevent any harmful or unintended outcomes, alignment ensures that an AI system’s actions authentically reflect human objectives and societal values, even when faced with unpredictable circumstances.\nFormally, if a policy \\(π\\) acts in an environment with dynamics \\(P(s′∣s,a)\\), alignment means that the induced behavior optimizes a human-intended reward \\(r_{human}(s,a)\\), not just a proxy training signal."

    "text": "Why AI Safety and Alignment Matter\nAI systems learn from data; they do not inherently understand human norms, ethics, or physical constraints. When they encounter situations that differ from their training data, a phenomenon known as distributional shift can lead to unexpected failures. We can think of training and deployment as two different distributions.\n\\[\nP_{train}(x) ≠ P_{deploy}(x)\n\\]\nThe most failures occur in regions where \\(P_{deploy}\\) places mass that \\(P_{train}\\) barely covers.\nIn common AI systems/digital systems , this might lead to:\n\nmisinformation,\nbiased or low-quality recommendations\noverconfident but incorrect responses\n\nIn cyber-physical systems, where the AI interacts with real hardware, the consequences can be more serious:\n\nequipment failures\nsafety hazards\nunstable operation\nlarge-scale service disruptions.\n\nThese risks show that alignment is essential. For AI systems impacting real-world processes, safety and alignment must be design priorities.\n\nThe stakes are higher because AI is now touching the real world. Alignment is no longer optional; it is now a minimum requirement."

    "text": "Understanding Failure Modes in RLHF\nMany large-scale AI models use Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to shape behavior. In practice, humans compare or rank model outputs, and the system learns a reward model \\(R_\\phi(x,a)\\) that approximates human preference. A policy \\(\\pi_{\\theta}\\) is then trained to maximize\n\\[\nE_{x,a ∼ \\pi_{\\theta}} [R_{\\phi}(x,a)] - \\lambda KL(\\pi_{\\theta} || \\pi_{base})\n\\]\nwhere the KL term keeps the new policy close to a base model.\nRLHF fails when:\n\nThe model mimics patterns instead of understanding values.\nWhen faced with unusual prompts or inputs (a significant distribution shift), the model may operate outside the area where \\(R_{\\phi}\\) is well-calibrated and disregard previous guidance.\nAttempts to make the model more “helpful” can unintentionally lead to overconfidence, as it may receive high rewards for providing fluent, authoritative answers, even when those answers are incorrect.\nModels aligned with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) can still exhibit unpredictable behavior when encountering adversarial prompts or previously unseen contexts.\n\nMy research investigates how these failure modes emerge and how they can be prevented. For example, this can be achieved by stress-testing policies under shifted distributions, adding robustness terms to the objective, or combining RLHF with explicit safety constraints. Understanding when alignment breaks is the first step in redesigning AI systems that remain trustworthy even under stress."

These systems merge computation with real-world activities, including power flow, traffic control, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation. Any misalignment between AI decisions and real-world constraints can have physical consequences.\nA useful formalism for addressing these issues is the constrained Markov decision process (CMDP).\n\\[\n\\max_{\\pi} \\mathbb{E}[R]\n\\quad \\text{s.t.} \\quad\n\\mathbb{E}[C_i] \\le d_i,; i = 1,\\ldots,m.\n\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(R\\) is the task reward (efficiency, performance, cost),\n\\(C_{i}\\) are costs capturing safety violations or constraint breaches,\n\\(d_{i}\\) are acceptable risk budgets.\n\nKey principles of safe, CPS-aligned AI include:\n\nRobustness\nThe AI must withstand noisy data, unexpected inputs, model mismatch, and adversarial attempts to manipulate its behavior. In robust formulations, we often optimize the worst-case value over an uncertainty set of dynamics \\(P\\): \\[\nV^{\\text{robust}}_{\\pi}\n= \\min_{P \\in \\mathcal{P}} ;\\mathbb{E}_{P}\\left[ \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\gamma^{t} r(s_t, a_t) \\right]\n\\]\n\n\nTransparency\nHuman operators should be able to interpret why a model makes a particular decision, especially in high-stakes contexts. This can mean interpretable policies, post-hoc explanations, or monitors that surface why constraints were or weren’t enforced.\n\n\nConstraint Awareness\nThe AI must respect physical, operational, and safety limits even when optimizing performance. In implementation, this often means projecting actions back into a safe set:\n\\[\na^{safe}_{t} = \\prod_{A_{safe}}(a_t)\n\\]\nwhere, \\(\\prod\\) is a projection operator and \\(A_{safe}\\) encodes domain knowledge and physics.\n\n\nResilience\nCPS (Cyber-Physical Systems) should maintain safe operation even in the face of disruptions, sensor errors, or cyberattacks. This can be achieved through redundancy, fault detection, and implementing policies that allow for graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure.\nThe fundamental aim is straightforward: AI should not unexpectedly affect those who rely on it, especially in situations involving physical systems."

Suppose we give it a reward like:\n\\[\nr(s,a)=−energy_{cost}(s,a)\n\\] The AI may discover that turning off specific equipment (HVAC, ventilation, and lighting) saves the most energy, and it might pursue that action even if the equipment is essential for maintaining air quality, occupant safety, or supporting medical devices.\nThis is misalignment: the AI optimized the metric we provided, but overlooked the broader human intention.\nMathematically, we trained for \\(r_{proxy}\\) instead of the actual human reward \\(r_{human}\\). Generalizing from this example, any CPS controlled by AI must be designed so that the model understands not only what to optimize, but also what boundaries must never be crossed and what additional objectives (such as comfort, fairness, and reliability) matter."
