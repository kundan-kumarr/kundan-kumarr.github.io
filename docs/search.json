Precision: A measure of a classifiers exactness. Recall: A measure of a classifiers completeness F1 Score (or F-score): A weighted average of precision and recall. Avoid accuracy as the metric (it will be misleading).\nPrefer metrics that account for imbalance:\nPrecision, Recall, F1-score\nROC-AUC, PR-AUC (especially useful with rare positives)\nMatthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC)\nBalanced Accuracy\n. Data Collection & Domain Knowledge\nGather more examples of the minority class if possible (often the best long-term solution).\nUse domain knowledge to engineer features that help separate classes better.\nActive learning: selectively label more examples from uncertain regions.\n\nAdvanced / Modern Techniques\n\nGenerative Models (GANs, VAEs): to synthesize minority samples.\nSemi-supervised or Self-supervised Learning: leverage unlabeled data to improve representation of minority class.\nFocal Loss (in deep learning): gives higher weight to hard-to-classify (often minority) samples.\nCourse link"

    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun!

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjective\nWind energy technologies, including advanced management and scheduling, rely on accurate wind power forecasting (WPF) for optimal operation. Enhancing forecast precision is crucial for reducing volatility in wind power and improving forecasting reliability. While forecasting methods estimate future values from historical data, traditional approaches often struggle with computational efficiency and model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting model that integrates multi- variate estimation (MVE) and pure prediction (TSP) using a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (Bi- LSTM) optimized with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)- based Bayesian optimization. The model incorporates numerical weather prediction (NWP) data for real-time forecasting, a key limitation in existing methods. MVE utilizes features such as wind speed, direction, temperature, and pressure, while TSP captures historical power generation patterns. The TPE-optimized Bi-LSTM architecture effectively captures bidirectional temporal dependencies, improving in both short-term and long-term forecasting. The model is evaluated using a six-year historical wind energy dataset from NREL, with performance assessed through RMSE, MAE, and R2 score. It outperforms traditional LSTM variants (Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-LSTM) and state-of-the-art models such as Transformers and GRUs, achieving R² scores of 0.976 for MVE and 0.932, 0.928, and 0.864 for TSP across short-term, day- ahead, and long-term forecasting, respectively. Additionally, TPE based Bayesian optimization reduces computational time around 8-10%, enhancing hyperparameter tuning efficiency. The study further analyzes the model’s computational burden, scalability, and practical implementation, offering a robust and efficient approach for improving wind power forecasting accuracy. \n\n\nMethod\n(\\(N_{ASD}=23\\), \\(N_{NT}=52\\))\n\n\nResults\n\n\nConclusions"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nEffective human-machine collaboration can significantly improve many learning and planning strategies for information gathering via fusion of ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ data originating from machine and human sensors, respectively. However, gathering the most informative data from human sensors without task overloading remains a critical technical challenge. In this context, Value of Information (VOI) is a crucial decision- theoretic metric for scheduling interaction with human sensors. We present a new Deep Learning based VOI estimation framework that can be used to schedule collaborative human-machine sensing with efficient online inference and minimal policy hand-tuning. Supervised learning is used to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract hierarchical features from ‘images’ of belief spaces obtained via data fusion. These features can be associated with soft data query choices to reliably compute VOI for human interaction. The CNN framework is described in detail, and a performance comparison to a feature- based POMDP scheduling policy is provided. The practical feasibility of our method is also demonstrated on a mobile robotic search problem with language-based semantic human sensor inputs."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe integration of renewable energy resources has made power system management increasingly complex. DRL is a potential solution to optimize power system operations, but it requires significant time and resources during training. The control policies developed using DRL are specific to a single grid and require retraining from scratch for other grids. Training the DRL model from scratch is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel TL with a DRL framework to optimize VV C across different grids. This framework significantly reduces training time and improves VVC control performance by fine-tuning pre-trained DRL models for various grids. We developed a policy reuse classifier that transfers the knowledge from the IEEE-123 Bus system to the IEEE-13 Bus system. We performed an impact analysis to determine the effectiveness of TL. Our results show that TL improves the VVC control policy by 69.51 %, achieves faster convergence, and reduces the training time by 98.14%."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntegrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into a power system requires more advanced control mechanisms. One of the control strategies used for Volt-VAR control (VVC) is to manage voltage and reactive power. With the increase in the complexity of the power system, there is a need to develop an autonomous and robust control mechanism using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enhance grid performance and adjust voltage and reactive power settings. These adjustments minimize losses and enhance voltage stability in the grid. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to develop a DRL-based VVC framework and mitigation techniques to protect against stealthy white-box attacks targeting the trained control policies of the DRL model. The mitigation technique on the trained DRL is proposed to control the voltage violations on the smart grid to enhance the stability of the grid and minimize voltage irregularities. Our proposed mitigation technique provided better control policies for DRL-based VVC, successfully mitigating 100 percent of voltage violations in the smart grid environment. The results show that the mitigation technique enhances the security and robustness of trained DRL VVC agents."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAs renewable energy sources become more integrated into the power grid, efficient scheduling of household energy consumption is essential to reduce costs and carbon footprint. In this paper, we introduce an energy optimization framework that optimizes the timing of appliance use based on dynamic carbon intensity and electricity prices. We determine optimal operation schedules using a multi-objective optimization model with a Gurobi solver and machine learning. We combine Random Forest and XGBoost for demand prediction, incorporating their uncertainty estimates into the optimization constraints. The model optimizes ON/OFF appliance schedules while considering constraints like minimum operating times and power balance. It shifts usage to lower-cost and carbon-intensity periods, which helps to reduce energy consumption.\nKey contributions include ML-based demand predictions and mixed-integer programming (MIP) optimization that improves robustness to prediction errors while adjusting schedules based on time-of-use pricing and carbon intensity. Our smart scheduling and load shifting achieve a 35.8% reduction in costs, a 38.6% decrease in carbon emissions, and a 25.8% reduction in peak demand using a carbon-aware scheduling algorithm. This framework effectively shifts loads to low-cost, low-carbon times, offering significant economic and environmental benefits for residential energy management without compromising user comfort."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe high penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the grid introduces complexity to the operation and optimization of energy. One potential solution to the challenge is to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based techniques to regulate voltage and reactive power under dynamic conditions. However, there is a need to optimize the DRL for better performance and robustness. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization (BO) technique within the DRL framework to improve the performance and robustness of volt-var control (VVC) in power distribution systems. We combine the actor-critic DRL algorithm with the BO framework to yield fast optimal volt-var control policies. We use BO techniques to estimate DRL-based VVC decisions and accelerate model-training convergence. In the case study, we demonstrated that the BO in DRL on IEEE-13 has improved decision-making by 21.11% and 81.81% for 123 bus test systems. Our research shows that Bayesian-enabled DRL adapts to different grid configurations and maintains voltage profiles within desired limits, thereby improving DRL control policies."

Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public.

    "text": "Unlocking Advanced AI: Prompting for LLM Reasoning and Planning\nAre you ready to unlock the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and elevate your interaction with artificial intelligence? This learning path is designed to equip you with powerful prompting techniques essential for building sophisticated AI agents. Mastering these skills allows you to guide LLMs through complex, multi-step tasks, improving the accuracy, relevance, and utility of their outputs for real-world applications.\nLarge Language Models have created a new computing paradigm largely based on how we write prompts. This learning journey is focused on how advanced prompting techniques enable AI applications to become AI agents. By the end of the journey, you’ll understand the mechanics and possess the skills to apply prompting techniques to agentic AI systems. The Need for Agentic AI: Debugging Complex Code\nImagine you’re tasked with building an automated system to help developers debug complex code. Simply feeding the buggy code and the error message into a standard LLM often results in generic suggestions that miss the specific context of the larger project. The LLM might suggest superficial fixes or even introduce new bugs.\nHow can you create an AI assistant that acts more like an experienced senior developer – one that can break down the problem, hypothesize potential causes, decide which parts of the code to inspect, integrate information from different files, update tests, and even learn from its failures? This requires moving beyond single-shot prompts to build a system capable of multi-step reasoning, planning, and execution – precisely the prompting techniques we’ll master.\nWhy is a single, simple prompt often insufficient for guiding an LLM through a complex or multi-step task? Correct! A single prompt is like giving a single instruction, whereas complex tasks require an ongoing dialogue. To act like an “experienced senior developer,” the AI needs to be guided through a process of breaking down the problem, investigating, and integrating information—steps that require a sequence of prompts to manage the plan and its execution effectively.\nThink about a complex, multi-step project you’ve recently worked on, either personally or professionally. This could be anything from planning a detailed event, to troubleshooting a tricky problem at home or work, or even tackling a challenging creative endeavor.\nFoundational Understanding of LLMs: You should know what a Large Language Model (LLM) is at a conceptual level, including its general capabilities (e.g., text generation, understanding) and the basic idea of using “prompts” to interact with it.\nBriefly describe the project and list 3-4 distinct steps you had to take to move it forward.\nNow, imagine you were trying to get a standard AI assistant (like a basic chatbot) to complete the entire project for you using only a single request or prompt.\nBased on your experience with AI, at which specific step do you predict the AI would most likely fail, misunderstand, or give a generic, unhelpful response? Why do you think that particular step would be the breaking point for a single-prompt approach?\n\nprobabilistic In the context of interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM), what is a ‘prompt’?\n\nThe input text or instructions probide to guide its response Large Language Model (LLM)? A ML model trained on the vast amounts of text data to understand, sumamrize , generate and predict context\nThroughout this course, you’ll explore:\nThe world of AI Agents, understanding their core components and how they reason, plan, and interact with their digital environments.\n\nThe art and science of advanced prompting techniques, mastering how to instruct LLMs with precision and nuance.\n\nCrafting specialized personas using role-based prompting to make AI outputs more targeted and contextually relevant.\n\nUnlocking problem-solving abilities using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to guide the LLM's reasoning process and ReAct (Reason + Act) to enable LLMs to use tools and take actions.\n\nThe process of prompt instruction refinement, learning to systematically analyze and adjust your prompts for optimal performance.\n\nBuilding multi-step agentic workflows by chaining prompts together, allowing AI to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nPrompt Chaining & Feedback Loops: Building robust, multi-step workflows that allow an AI to tackle complex tasks and even improve its own work based on feedback.\nEnd of Course Project: Agentsville Trip Planner\nAt the end of the course, you’ll attempt to build the “Agentsville Trip Planner Assistant” project, a smart agent that can take a complex request and see it through to completion. This is your opportunity to see just how powerful prompting can be in agentic AI. You will apply all of the individual skills you learned to create a truly capable system.\nWe want to wish you the very best of luck! You’re about to start a journey to harness the incredible power of Large Language Models. Get ready to move beyond basic interactions and learn how to architect and guide AI.\nBy the end of this journey, you will have acquired the skills to:\nExplain AI systems that utilize LLMs for sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities.\nMaster a range of advanced prompting strategies to elicit precise behavior and information from LLMs.\nSystematically optimize and refine your prompts, transforming general AI responses into highly specific and useful outputs.\nConstruct multi-step AI workflows that can handle complex, real-world challenges.\nImplement mechanisms for validation and iterative improvement, leading to more reliable AI agents.\nUltimately, transform generic Large Language Models into specialized, powerful tools tailored to solve intricate problems across various domains.\nThis course will both challenge you and equip you with the cutting-edge skills needed to innovate in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. We’re excited to see what you’ll learn and, eventually, what you’ll build. Good luck!"

Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique for Volt-Var Control (VVC) — regulating voltage levels across the distribution grid — but its Achilles’ heel lies in expensive retraining.\nEvery new grid topology or environment demands retraining from scratch, costing time, data, and computational energy.\nIn our latest work, presented at the Workshop on Autonomous Energy Systems (GRID-EDGE 2025), we introduce a Transfer Learning (TL)-based DRL framework that enables policy reuse across different grid configurations — cutting training time by 98.14% while improving performance by 69.51%."

TL-DRL systems, however, transfer policy knowledge from a source grid (e.g., IEEE-123 Bus) to a target grid (e.g., IEEE-13 Bus).\n\nThis approach allows agents to start smarter, building upon previously learned representations rather than reinventing them. The heart of this system is a policy reuse classifier, a small neural network that decides when the previously learned policy should be reused or adapted."

    "text": "How It Works\nThe framework operates in three phases:\n\n1. Source Training\nA DRL agent, using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, learns to manage the IEEE-123 Bus system. The policy parameters, denoted as θₛₒᵤᵣcₑ, optimize voltage levels and reactive power flow according to ANSI C84.1-2020 voltage standards.\n\n\n2. Policy Reuse Classifier\nWe train a binary classifier that predicts the probability of reusing a learned policy: [ P(|) = (f_()) ] If this probability exceeds 0.5, the source policy is transferred directly; otherwise, the agent retrains in the target environment.\n\n\n3. Target Adaptation\nThe target model (θₜₐᵣgₑₜ) adapts to the IEEE-13 Bus through fine-tuning and Q-value updates, balancing exploration and exploitation dynamically: [ = P(|) ] This adaptive mechanism allows the agent to decide when to trust previous experience and when to explore new strategies."

Why AI Research Interviews Are Different\nResearch hiring revolves around one core question:\n\nCan you take an ambiguous problem and turn it into a clear idea, an experiment, a result, and an impact?\n\nTo answer this, interviewers probe six major capabilities:\n\nResearch depth\nCan you clearly explain the gap, the idea, the method, the evidence, and the limitations of your work?\nTechnical foundations\nMath, ML, optimization, probability, RL, uncertainty modeling, transformers, and systems fundamentals.\nExperimentation mindset\nHow you design baselines, run ablations, debug failures, reason about data, and measure uncertainty.\nSystems thinking\nHow your ideas turn into deployed systems—latency, reliability, guardrails, monitoring, drift, and safety.\nExecution\nCan you scope, prototype, iterate, debug, and deliver—papers, code, and production impact?\nCommunication\nCan you explain complex ideas clearly to engineers, PMs, research peers, and leadership?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor each project, try this lens:\nproblem → gap → idea → method → evidence → limitations → next steps → impact"

Research Narrative Questions\nThese assess your clarity, causality, and scientific maturity.\n\nWhat was the original problem motivation, and what gap in prior work did you identify?\nIf someone tries to reproduce your paper, what is the first place they might get stuck—and why?\nWhat is the core equation behind your method? Derive it.\nHow did you choose hyperparameters and baselines? What alternatives did you reject, and why?\nWhat was your strongest ablation and the most surprising negative result?\nWhat are the three biggest assumptions in your work? How do they impact generalization?\nExplain one design decision that turned out to be wrong. What did you learn?\nIf you had 3 more months, what experiment would you run first?\n\n\n\n2. Machine Learning Fundamentals\n\nThese evaluate foundations beyond “tool usage.”\nExplain bias–variance tradeoff using a real ML experiment you ran.\nWhy is cross-entropy the default classification loss?

When not?\n\n\n\n4. Reinforcement Learning / Control\nVery common for robotics, energy, and autonomy research teams.\n\nDerive the policy gradient theorem.\nExplain GAE and how it stabilizes PPO.\nWhat causes PPO instability? Diagnose this using logs.\nCompare TD3 vs. SAC—where does each shine?\nWhat’s your exploration story? What happens if it collapses too early?\nHow do you enforce safety constraints in RL?\nDesign an experiment to detect reward hacking.\nWhy is offline RL difficult?

    "text": "3. Phase 1 Interview Preparation Roadmap\nPreparing for a research scientist role isn’t a weekend sprint. The plan below assumes ~100 days (around 14–15 weeks) of disciplined, focused preparation. Think of it as 10 phases (≈10 days each), grouped into larger thematic blocks.\n#100DaysofPreparation\n\n3.1 (Weeks 1–2) Build Your Research Portfolio Foundation\nGoal: Establish your scientific identity and core artifacts.\nWhat to accomplish:\n\nSelect 2–3 flagship projects — the ones you want to be hired for.\nWrite one-page summaries for each:\n\nproblem → gap → idea → method → evidence → limits.\n\nOrganize code, plots, logs, notebooks, and experiment sheets into a clean structure.\nRefresh foundational ML math:\n\nGradients, softmax, cross-entropy\nBias–variance tradeoff, generalization\nRegularization basics (weight decay, dropout)\n\nReview optimization basics:\n\nSGD, AdamW\nLearning rate warmup, cosine decay\nMLE vs. MAP\n\nDo light DS&A:\n\n20–30 minutes/day on arrays/strings, hash maps, basic trees.\n\n\nOutcome: A clear, coherent scientific story and crisp articulation of your contributions.\nFollow-along tasks:\n\nCreate a Portfolio/ folder and write 3 one-page project summaries.\nList your 5 strongest experimental results (with metrics and context).\nSummarize 3 papers from your target teams (FAANG, DeepMind, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.).\n\n\n\n3.2 (Weeks 3–4) Deep Learning & Modern Architectures Refresh\nGoal: Regain fluency in the architectures that power modern AI systems.\nTopics to review:\n\nCNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, GRUs\nTransformers: attention, QKV projections, multi-head attention\nResidual connections, LayerNorm, normalization strategies\nKL divergence, entropy, cross-entropy\nPositional encodings, rotary embeddings (RoPE)\nRegularization techniques: dropout, mixup, cutmix, label smoothing\nTraining dynamics:\n\nGradient flow\nVanishing/exploding gradients\nLoss landscapes, sharpness, generalization behavior\n\n\nFollow-along tasks: - Re-derive softmax + cross-entropy and their gradients. - Solve 10 small gradient/optimization exercises. - Summarize 3 internals of transformers (e.g., QKV, attention, layer norm) in your own words.\nHands-on:\n\nRebuild a transformer encoder from scratch in PyTorch (minimal but clean).\nImplement vision augmentations (random crop, flip, color jitter).\nReproduce a small-scale paper result (e.g., CIFAR-10 or MNIST baseline).\n\nOutcome: You should be comfortable answering: “How does this model actually work?” instead of just “It’s a transformer.”\n\n\n3.3 (Weeks 5–6) Deep Reinforcement Learning Refresher\nGoal: Achieve deep, working-level confidence with modern DRL.\nCore topics:\n\nDerive the policy gradient theorem from first principles.\nUnderstand Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) and why it stabilizes training.\nBuild intuition for PPO and TRPO:\n\nClipped objective\nTrust regions\nKL constraints\n\nMaster key off-policy algorithms:\n\nDQN, TD3, SAC\nWhen to use which (discrete/continuous, exploration needs).\n\nReplay buffers, target networks, delayed policy updates.\nExploration vs exploitation in discrete and continuous settings.\nDiagnosing RL instability:\n\nValue drift\nEntropy collapse\nMis-scaled advantages\nReward hacking\n\nSafety-aware RL:\n\nConstraint handling, shields,

systems.\n\nFollow-along tasks:\n\nWrite out the PPO objective and update rule by hand, including clipping, advantage, and entropy terms.\nImplement PPO or DQN from scratch in PyTorch (keep it minimal but readable).\nRe-derive the REINFORCE update starting from log-likelihood gradients.\nWrite a one-paragraph explanation of what causes PPO instability and how you’d detect it.\nRead two recent RL papers from your target teams.\nTrain a simple RL agent:\n\nCartPole, or\nA domain-specific environment like OpenDSS/CityLearn.\n\nStudy 2–3 DRL papers closely related to your dream role.\n\nOutcome: Confidently explain, derive, implement, and debug modern RL algorithms and discuss where they fail.\n\n\n3.4 (Weeks 7–8) LLMs, RAG, Multimodal Systems, Prompting & Finetuning\nGoal: Build a strong working mastery of LLMs and the surrounding ecosystem.\nTopics:\n\nPretraining vs finetuning vs RLHF vs instruction tuning.\nParameter-efficient finetuning:\n\nLoRA, QLoRA,
