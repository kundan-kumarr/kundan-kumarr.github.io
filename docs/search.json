    "text": "i! I’m Kundan Kumar, a Ph.D. candidate and researcher focused on building intelligent, secure, and adaptable AI systems for next-generation cyber-physical infrastructure. My work bridges deep reinforcement learning (DRL), multi-agent systems, large language models (LLMs), safe and explainable AI, and computer vision, with real-world applications in smart grids, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure.\nMy Ph.D. research centers on physics-informed and safety-critical DRL frameworks that embed domain knowledge, safety constraints, and uncertainty into the learning process—enabling agents to make robust and interpretable decisions in dynamic, complex environments. My research within DRL focuses on techniques such as transfer learning, uncertainty quantification, and adversarial resilience to improve generalization, safety, and reliability across diverse tasks and environments.\nI also develop LLM-integrated simulation frameworks for robotics and autonomous systems, combining vision-based perception, trajectory planning, and natural language reasoning to support high-level control and human-AI collaboration.\nBeyond research, I enjoy sharing my insights through educational content on Substack and YouTube. Outside of work, I love cooking and Ice skating 🛼."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Github as a platform\n\nOn contribution\nNearly half of all contributors only contributed once; which accounted for less than 2% of total commits.\nThe pattern that one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by many casual contributors and even more passive users is the norm, not exception in open source.\nOn casual contributors: they primarily see themselves as users of the project, rather than a part of a contributor community.\nChallenge for maintainers: not how to get more contributors, but how to manage high volume of frequent, low-touch interactions (directing air traffic)\n\nGithub’s open source developers have more in common with solo creators on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or Twitch.\n\nComparing early internet and social platform nowadays: the early online communities have mailing lists, online forums, membership groups, operated like villages that have their own culture, history and norms. Nowadays creators have much bigger potential audience but the relationship is one-sided, and can be overwhelming.\n\n\nOn free software and hacker\n“Free” means you are able to do what you want with the software, rather than the cost. Libre rather than gratis. At least at the beginning.\nBravado, showmanship, mischievousness, deep mistrust of authority. This culture in the 1980s and 90s was closely linked to the early open source software.\n“Bazaar”: highly participatory, versus “Cathedral”: restricted to a smaller group\nToday’s developer hardly even notice “open source” as a concept anymore, they just want to write and publish their code. They prioritize convenience over freedom or openness.\n\n\nOn licensing\nThe widespread use of permissive licensing is popularized by GH.\nCopyleft licensing (e.g. GNU General Public License GPL) is not commercial friendly as it requires companies to license their software that depend on open source GPL software to have the same license. However GPL gives developers more control over how others use their code in the long run.\n\nAs with any other online content today, sharing is the default.\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of an open source software\n\nOn how projects evolve\nCreate -&gt; Promote and distribute -&gt; Grow\nProjects are promoted like a founder would promote a startup: share on the relevant channels online, give talks at conference and meetups, encourage others to write and talk about it\nA sign that the software is used widely: when the maintainer starts doing more non-code (triage issues, review pull requests) rather than code work.\n\n\nContributor and users\nDepends on technical scope (whether there is much to do), support required (code and admin work), ease of participation (whether on Github) and user adoption (potential contributor base).\nFour types of projects\n\nhigh user growth, high contributor growth: federations. Rare, impactful, the ‘ideal’ of open source project. Roughly 3% of open source projects. Examples: Rust, Node.js, Linux\nhigh user growth, low contributor growth: stadiums: powered by one or a few developers. Centralized.\nlow user growth, high contributor growth: club. Similar to meetup or hobby groups, do not have a wide reach but are loved and built by enthusiasts.\nlow user growth, low contributor growth: toys. Personal project, isn’t trying to grow its user base. Projects on Github with less than 10 stars. Authors do not expect to receive contributions nor do they care about whether people are watching.\n\nDecentralized communities (clubs and federations) have the potential for high user growth - recruit new contributors, reduce contribution friction.\nCentralized communities (stadium) depends on the creators to manage user demand - automation, elimination of noise\n\n\n\nRoles, incentives and relationships\n\nFirms or communities\nFirms (companies, organizations): centralized resources; from a coordination standpoint, managing resources would be more efficient within the same organization - which does not explain why open source developers make software together without formal contracts and financial compensation.\n\n\nThe commons and peer production\nTragedy of the commons: resources depleted by people acting in their own self-interest rather than in the collective interest.\n(One of the 8 design principles by Ostrom on) successful commons:\n\nThose who are affecteed by the rules can participate in modifying them.\n\nStrong sense of group identity maks rules, dispute resolution more meaningful.\nCoordination cost is lower when self-organized based on who wants to do the work most, anyone can do the advertised work and volunteer.\nIn contrast, in companies - solicit, evaluate, hire, manage employees; only employees can do the work limited by their job functions.\nPeople collaborating online for no obvious reason beyond personal satisfaction (intrinsic motivation)\nModular and granular tasks: how tasks are organized, and how big each task is.\nLow coordination costs: quality control over thee modules, integrate the contributions into the finished product\n\n\nContribution beyond code\nSome users do not consider them a contributor, but do actually contribute by education, spreading the word, support (forum), bug reports and more.\nThese active users are similar to contributors but operate independently from project’s contributor community."

    "text": "The IBS (International Biometric Society) conference of the Central European Network, CEN2023 has been a great opportunity to keep myself up to date with the latest development of biostatistics, both in academia and industry. Thanks to the great effort made by the organizing committee and almighty Google Meet/Zoom, I have been able to follow the talks without any issue, and have definitely learned a lot.\nGiven my background, I paid more attention on talks and workshops on\n\nStatistical software, R programming and simulation\nCausal inference\n\nThere were also two topics that drew my attention: one is on statistical education towards medial professionals, the other is on a Data Challenge using RCT data.\n\nStatistical software\n\nSoftware Engineering Working Group (SWE WG), MMRM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Sabanes Bove (Roche).

Currently they have 3 work streams:\n\nmmrm implements MMRM (mixed models with repeated measures)\nbrms.mmrm, the Bayesian version of MMRM\nHealth Technology Assessment with R\n\nAt a later talk, mmrm was compared with SAS’s PROC MIXED and R’s nlme, glmmTMB for analyses of longitudinal continuous endpoints. In terms of speed and convergence, mmrm is superior than others; while the estimate prodouced by mmrm is very close to PROC MIXED and glmmTMB.\nThis looks like a very interesting tool to try out! Vignette\n\n\nSimulation tools and RWD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Kammer (Medical University of Vienna). An overview of R software tools to support simulation studies: towards standardizing coding practices.\n\n\n\n\nKammer and colleagues did a review on R packages for simulation, and selected 14 top simulation packages, including simstudy, simdata, synthpop, bigsimr and others. The full list is made available here.\nA real-world dataset, NHANES was also introduced here. The data can be accessed with R package nhanesA.\n\n\n\nCausal Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop: Implementing the estimand framework in global drug development: Application of causal inference approaches (Mouna Akacha, Björn Bornkamp, Alex Ocampo, Jiawei Wei at Novartis)\nKeynote: Ruth Keogh (LSHTM). Causal inference with observational data: A survival guide\n\n\n\nThese two workshop / talk cover slightly different scenarios: one in RCT, one for observational data. It deserves a whole article or more to elaborate on this topic, so I’m only putting some resources here.\nCausal inference is definitely gaining traction in recent years in both academia and industry. Techniques such as g-computation, IPW and doubly robust estimation are starting to become mainstream. It is fascinating that these techniques themselves are not bound to a fixed model.\nResources:\n\nWorkshop repository Causal-inference-in-RCTs\nBook: Causal Inference: What If by Hernán and Robins (2020)\nPrincipal stratum strategy, Bornkamp et al. (2021)\nTime-dependent covariates, Keogh et al. (2023)\nTarget Trial Emulation (TTE), Hernán and Robins (2016)\n\n\n\nCovariate adjustment and data challenge with RCT data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Van Lancker (Ghent University). Improving Power in Randomized Trials by Leveraging Baseline Variables\nDominic Magirr (Novartis). Organizing a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\nCraig Wang (Novartis). Participating in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\n\nPanel discussion: Jonathan Bartlett (LSHTM)\n\n\n\n23 teams at Novartis participated in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment. They were given a fixed outcome model, and 5 prior studies trial data, and their task was to create the design matrices that improve the precision compared to unadjusted data.\nIf I were to select talks based on the category titles, I would probably missed the whole session. However, it is surprisingly similar to using not trial, but real-world data (such as EHR) to make predictions. The conclusion were similar as well: using “supercovariates” created by ML isn’t gaining much compared to simple models such as ANCOVA. Possible reasons:\n\nsmall to moderate data size\nlinear relationship between covariates and outcome\ngood enough prognostic variables\n\nIt was also mentioned that the winning team did some trick to reduce the variance among the covariates. Would be interesting to read about it.\nSome resources:\n\nLancker et al. The use of covariate adjustment in randomized controlled trials: an overview link\nCovariate adjustment tutorial, link\n\n\n\nStatistical education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaren Vens et al (University of Lübeck). Biostatistics/Biometrics for physicians – essential or unnecessary? How do practicing physicians and dentists evaluate biostatistics? A cross-sectional survey\n\n\n\n\nStatistical education to students / professionals who are not used to working with data has always been tricky. Students generally think statistics is difficult, and need help from a statistician. However there are only limited number of statisticians. The talk by Vens and colleagues confirms what practicing statisticians know, but can’t do much about: most (87%) physicians and dentists in the survey need a statistician to help with their work.\nHow to improve the statistical competency is an important and relevant topic for discussion, and might require systematic changes in how it is taught. Use of modern technology can help, yet it’s only helpful when students start to not fear, or not find math and technology boring."

It is not necessary to have a paid coursera membership to view the course, everyone could access it.\nIt is a 4 part course released one month ago (Jan/Feb 2023), and it seems that a follow-up will be released in the future.\nOverall I think it strikes a good balance between high-level introduction of the good practices, and examples with how they are implemented. Even though the course focuses on clinical reporting in the pharmaceutical industry, the practices are highly relevant in other sectors as well (e.g. public health, academia, other industries that use open-source software).\nSpecific statistical methods, packages are introduced only at a high-level; which means the course is not for learning how to use this or that packages; but good practice guidelines.\nIn my opinion,\n\nit would be useful if the learner has some experience with software development and/or statistics; otherwise learners might not know how to practice them.\nmost of the examples are related to R packages (understandable), so some experience with R package (use or develop) is useful.\nit could be a very good study material for university students in related subjects.\n\n\n\n\nModule 1 (notes): what the requirements are regarding clinical reporting, what should be done to meet the quality standards;\nModule 2 (notes): DevOps and Agile\nModule 3 (notes): version Control, git workflows, reproducible clinical reporting\nModule 4 (notes): code quality, robust and reusable code, R packages\nModule 5 (notes): risk management with open source software\n\n\n\n\nI have a few years of experience as an R developer and academic researcher in related fields, so not all concepts are new to me.

It was initially a cure for a severe burnout from a combination of work-related stressors, when I desperately needed something other than research. My mental state was like the famous painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experience of the switch was explained in the previously mentioned blog. Briefly, it was light like a feather. Since I was quite satisfied, I thought, why don’t I make a workshop website? So I did.\nThe result was quite good, I made the (as far as I knew) first quarto workshop website at University of Oslo for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2022. Feedback from students were positive, and the instructor team thought it hosts the material in a more organized way.\n\n\nSingle day workshop -&gt; two week course\nI was greatly encouraged by the experience, so when I got a 50% position at University of Oslo as biostatistics lecturer, I thought, why don’t we have the same thing for the course?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh well, the workload is crushing. There were a few key differences:\n\nR scripts and material were unavailable since the course was originally in STATA. Everything need to be done from scratch, for at least 12 lab sessions;\nThe students generally have little IT skills, which means more effort need to be done to guide them through the ‘get started’ part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took one month to create the first version of the website. More details about the experience can be read here.\n\n\nAdding WebR to the course\nOne year later, as technology advances, we added new content to some parts of the website. Most notably is the interactivity achieved through WebR. For example, I made this page on randomness and statistical distribution where students can interactively modify code chunks in a web browser."

I’m going to check out the scss variables in quarto which defines the theme, theme_file.scss.

    "title": "Open source reporting with R: clinical, public health, RSE and embrace the change",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Two days ago (Jan 11 2023) I watched a presentation by data scientists at Roche about why they are making their clinical trials in 2023 open source with R. As someone who uses R for most of the time and has done similar works (not in pharma, but in public health surveillance and reporting: watch my talk, slides to find out what we do), I watched the presentation with great interest. Here are my notes, combined with some thoughts on open-source in the industry, public sector and academia.\n\nThree reasons for why I am writing this blog\n\nNote down some of the technology which points towards the future of the field\nRelate to my experience of open-source applied in public health, specifically public health reporting\nShare some thoughts in statistical education of applied students/researchers (e.g. medicine), and training Research Software Engineers\n\n\n\nMy experience with statistical software\nTo put my opinions in perspective,\n\nI do not have experience with SAS or pharma, so I do not have first-hand knowledge on the functionality, ease-of-use or the popularity of commercial softwares in the industry.\nI did my MSc and PhD in statistics/biostatistics/medical informatics and R had always been a default choice.\nI worked in public health for a few years, where Excel is possibly the most common tool, and STATA and R are scarcely used (statisticians, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians).\nIn the past few years, my university has made the switch from SPSS to STATA for intro statistics for medical students (while students at higher level, or doing advanced analyses might use R/python), and a test-run with R might be in motion.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Reporting\nIn drug development at pharmaceutical companies (and/or research institutes and hospitals), these data related tasks are very common:\n\nsummarise safety and efficacy data\nprovide accurate picture of trial outcomes\nmanage data collection across different sites\n\nCompleting these tasks in a correct, efficient and reproducible manner is crucial for patient safety. However, these tasks are also highly resource intensive: highly trained scientist, statisticians and technincians must be involved in the process. Historically, pharma use commercial software such as SAS.\n\nRegulation and exploration needs\nThere are requirements for clinical reporting: both regulartory and exploratory. From the regulatory side, there exist industry standards (CDISC) in the clinical research process, such as SDTM (Model for Tabulation of Study Data) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model). Statistical analyses, tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) also fall into this cateogory.\nFrom the exploratory side, clinical data are highly context dependent, and new formats of data such as imaging are more and more used in prediction modeling and drug development.\nIn addition, it is not hard to imagine that the technical competency of employees differ, especially in large organizations. Enabling people with less experience to analyse trial data in a reproducible manner is helpful for not only the learning and growth of employees, but also the productivity of organizations.\nThe existing commercial tools are not able to adapt to the rapid changes in the field.\n\n\nTransition into Open-Source\nIn this talk, Dr Kieran Martin at Roche introduced that they started using R as their core data science tool, aiming to move their codebase to having a core R. In the future, they plan to have something that is lanugage agnostic: meaning that python, Stan, C++, Julia and beyond can be used for different tasks.\nI only noted down a few of the things they mentioned on the infrastructure side:\n\nOCEAN - a lanugage agnostic computing platform on AWS (docker)\nGit, Gitlab for version control and collaboration\nRstudio connect server\nSnakemake for orchestrate production\n\n\n\nR and Shiny\nThere are obvious benefits of using R. It is convenient to install and use (if you used python and R, you’d probably agree), and the latest development in Shiny made it very easy to develop interactive visualizations, suitable for exploration. Package development is critical for reproducibility and distributing works - which R does it very well. A few packages developed by pharma are Teal and admiral: the ADaM in R, which I intend to check out at one point.\nR has deep roots in academia which means the newest statistical methods are well covered; which also affects the skill sets that talents own - fresh graduates probably already learned it at university. R being open source means that collaboration with external partners is much more efficient, and transparent. Strong community support is another positive thing that encourages beginners to enter the field and learn.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Public Health\n\nSurveillance and reporting\nOne key functionality of public health (PH) authorities is stay informed and inform. They collect data from labs, hospitals and clinics across the country, summarize into useful statistics in tables and graphs, make reports, then inform the policy makers to make decisions (such as vaccination campaigns).\nCompared to clinical reporting (in my understanding), there are many similarities - we make TLG (tables, listings and graphs). There are also features that make reporting in public health unique:\n\nPH surveillance and reporting are dynamic and real-time, which can change in a matter of days. That is because the situation of different infectious diseases can evolve rapidly, so PH authorities need to make appropriate adjustments.\nTime and location (spatial-temporal) are important. Different time granularity (daily, weekly) and geographical units (nation, county, municipality, city districts) are typically required for reporting.\n\n\n\nScale up and automate with open source tools\nTraditionally, these reports are made manually - one location, one graph per time on a certain disease. When a global pandemic hits, this is definitely not fast enough. At my team (Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health), we tried a different approach. Details of what we did can be found in this talk(slides), but to make it brief:\n\nWe developed a fully automated pipeline that connects 15 registries (vaccination, lab, hospital and intensive care and many more). The data is gathered, censored, cleaned and pre-processed for down-stream analysis\nStatistical analysis, tables, graphs and maps are made for all locations in Norway for various outcomes of interest, such as Covid, influenza, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nOver 1000 customized reports with over 30 graphs and tables are produced daily and sent to local PH officials, where we also had a shiny website (Kommunehelsetjenester for Kommunelege) for over 300 PH officials to get most up-to-date information about their own municipality\n\nBy automation, every year Sykdomspulsen can save 700 000 NOK (roughly 70k USD) while making 400 times more real-time reports for public health. Even better, with reproducibility and quality control.\n\n\nToolbox\nSykdomspulsen is a small team (8 people, 3 are statisticians and 1 engineer), and our infrastructure was built upon R packages, which we call splverse. Our infrastructure is not fundamentally different from the one Roche introduced, basically:\n\nR does the task planning and project organization. On top of this, the data cleaning, statistical analysis are implemented. Graphs, tables and maps are made with appropriate R packages\nRmarkdown does automated reporting into .docx and .xlsx. Some reports are also in .html tables to be embedded into customized emails\nRstudio Workbench and GitHub help with teamwork\n\nDocker, GoCD and Airflow do the CI/CD and orchestration\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the transition\n\nCulture change needed\nUnfortunately, not all organizations are eager to abandon the old way. Even at our own institute where researchers are the majority, open source and modern day programming is hardly practiced (by my observation). Even worse, under the budget cuts in 2023-24, a large number of younger employees who have the technical skills have left - which left the public health surveillance even more vulnerable now that Covid is far from over.\nIn my opinion, public health needs open-source and good programming even more than pharmaceutical companies. Both save lifes - and PH has less money to invest in softwares, infrastructures and talents. In this situation, resources should be spent in fields that are critical and most cost-effective; yet in reality this is often not the case.\nThe slow culture change at big organizations can happen, but only if there is a sufficient amount of employees who are willing to embrace the new technology. In the talk by Roche they about about their training strategy. It is not possible to train all users, and not everyone has the same needs at the same time. Therefore, self study with certain study paths is encouraged and supported.\n\n\nTeach programming to students in various fields\nBased on my experience in the UK and Norway, students (myself included) learn R programming in one of the two ways\n\nLearning by Googling (self-taught): a university degree needs to use it: provides a short introduction, then students learn by using. This is how I learned R at my MSc Statistics degree, and this is probably the most common way\nWorkshops at university: organizations such as the Carpentries provide course material and teaching a few times per year, where interested students (usually from subjects such as biology) come and learn. These classes are quite popular, and usually have a long waiting list.\n\nFrom learning by googling to some organized teaching - that is already some good progress. However, if not, can we improve?\nIn my experience with statistical advising with the university hospital, clinical researchers and medical students are enthusastic to get their statistics done, some are also eager to do some analysis themselves. That is good. Yet, there is generally lack of capacity - either knowledge or software skills. Once the statistician who helps with the project stops, the project ends. There is the need to have in-house statistical capacity. To this end, open-source softwares such as R, and good programming practice (reproducibility for example) can help a lot: the license doesn’t end, and everything is documented so that the next person can continue the work.\nI’m glad that my university has made some transitional efforts in this regard: STATA instead of SPSS is being taught to medical students as part of their statistics course. There might be a test-run in R soon, which is very exciting (since I’ll be involved in the teaching)!\n\n\nStatistical engineering and RSEs\nThat was the capacity building to get beginners more independent. On the other side, there is also the need for better programming practice for researchers at more advanced level. Research Software Engineering (RSE) is starting to get more and more attention, because it is not only relevant for research (i.e. getting papers published), but in broader applications.\nFor example, in the talk by Roche, they mentioned that “RSE teams need to accelerate adoption of new statistical methods and biomarker data analysis”, and the implementation with R packages and templates is at its core. In the future more languages would be included such as Python, Stan, C++ and Julia.\nHowever, RSE as a job title or career path is still a new thing. I know two RSEs at my university, and RSE is definitely not your typical academic faculty position: only departments that think it’s important makes positions, often not permanent. To get any new methods actually used in either industry or the public sector outside research, translating methods into tools is must-do. In the future I hope RSE becomes a stable and common career path, and more exciting things can happen."

    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.\nIn this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on ‘how’ to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

Sykdomspulsen processes new data collected from 15 data sources (e.g., covid-19 cases), runs 1000.000+ statistical analysis automatically for all locations (nation, county, municipality) in Norway, produces 1000+ reports and alerts for public health authorities and shares data to the public on GitHub.\nSykdomspulsen runs on a collection of R packages, the {splverse}. {splverse} is an ecosystem for infectious disease surveillance, from analysis planning, statistical analysis to reporting via visualization, shiny website and Rmarkdown generated reports. In this talk, Chi will present how Sykdomspulsen does public health real-time surveillance during the pandemic using R. Chi will introduce some of the core packages and illustrate how they work together, with an example using real surveillance data published daily on GitHub.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nChi is currently working at the Sykdomspulsen team as a researcher and R developer, at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Before she joined Sykdomspulsen in the middle of the pandemic (2020), she was a PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo (OCBE), working on hospital EHR data."

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

Between mid 2020 and early 2022, I was too stressed about completing my PhD, and balancing my other two jobs wasn’t the easiest thing. During this period, my mind had been going back to the old site from time to time, but it was hard to find enough time or energy to write about stuff."

    "title": "Website reboot: switching from Blogdown to Quarto",
    "section": "Time to try Quarto",
    "text": "Time to try Quarto\nNow that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks in October 2022, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!\nThere were quite a lot of discussions about Quarto in the summer 2022. I wasn’t following the discussions closely, but I remember there were quite a few talks in the Rstudio conference this year. Then more and more people switched to Quarto on Twitter. Then people I know also switched to Quarto. What’s the fuzz about?\nMy experience with Quarto is focused on websites. I have not tried other forms of publishing. So far I have created:\n\na workshop website for my colleagues\na personal website (the one you are reading right now)\nan R package (qtwAcademic)that wraps three Quarto website templates for beginners\n\nHere are a few things I like about Quarto. Given that I’m not very experienced in front-end development, these comments are going to be about ease-of-use and design, rather than the technicalities.\n\nClean look for both personal and workshop/courses\nWhen I was using “academic” template in blogdown, I liked the structure of the site: projects, talks, blog, softwares and publications sections are clearly displayed at the top. What I didn’t like is that the default homepage was a very long single page; yet its customisation wasn’t the easist. Other templates were either too simple (for blog only), or more suitable for image display (photography projects). I wanted a website that keep the good structure of “academic”, which is quite suitable for academics (hence the name); while keeping each section independent.\nWith distill I could achieve the structure I wanted; but I didn’t enjoy it too much as a personal website (at least it wasn’t as flexible as Quarto). distill is still pretty decent for organisations or documentation site.\nWith Quarto, I can achieve the desired looks for not only a personal website (with or without blogs), but also a workshop, event or even course website. This is fantastic! The top, sidebar or hybrid navigation makes the site structure very clear, especially when there are lots of content. As an aspiring lecturer at university, this is really One Quarto Rules Them All.\n\n\nFlexible yet not overwhelming\nAs I mentioned above, hacking “academic” in blogdown was not that easy - simply because there were too many folders that you are not actually supposed to modify. It was confusing to know what to change in order to achieve the desired output, and multiple folders were having the same names, making it very challenging for beginners. Ironically, this is usually the first template beginners start with!\nThat’s why I immediately fell for Quarto: you only need 4 components to make a decent minimalistic website work:\n\n_quarto.yml to control the overall layout\nindex.qmd at the root folder to control the homepage\nabout.qmd for some basic information about the creator or the website\nproject.qmd for projects or any other content that the creator wants to display\n\nThe way that _quarto.yml clearly specifies the .qmd files really helps beginners to understand where things are. This has been extremely useful for me when I wanted to learn how people made their website by reading the source code - I could understand exactly where to find the information I needed. The clear structure greatly helps the creators themselves, and also those who want to learn.\n\n\nGreat community\nRstats people have a great community. I wouldn’t be able to make my site the way I wanted if people haven’t been sharing their works. I have learned a lot by reading the source code by Dr Emi Tanaka, Dr David Schoch, Bea Milz, Prof Mine Cetinnkaya-Rundel’s STA 210 - Regression Analysis course.\nI also made my own R package that wraps three templates to create Quarto websites that are frequently used by academics, qtwAcademic. In the following days I plan to write up more detailed explanations on how to use the package, along with some new features."

    "text": "Unlocking Advanced AI: Prompting for LLM Reasoning and Planning\nAre you ready to unlock the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and elevate your interaction with artificial intelligence? This learning path is designed to equip you with powerful prompting techniques essential for building sophisticated AI agents. Mastering these skills allows you to guide LLMs through complex, multi-step tasks, improving the accuracy, relevance, and utility of their outputs for real-world applications.\nLarge Language Models have created a new computing paradigm largely based on how we write prompts. This learning journey is focused on how advanced prompting techniques enable AI applications to become AI agents. By the end of the journey, you’ll understand the mechanics and possess the skills to apply prompting techniques to agentic AI systems. The Need for Agentic AI: Debugging Complex Code\nImagine you’re tasked with building an automated system to help developers debug complex code. Simply feeding the buggy code and the error message into a standard LLM often results in generic suggestions that miss the specific context of the larger project. The LLM might suggest superficial fixes or even introduce new bugs.\nHow can you create an AI assistant that acts more like an experienced senior developer – one that can break down the problem, hypothesize potential causes, decide which parts of the code to inspect, integrate information from different files, update tests, and even learn from its failures? This requires moving beyond single-shot prompts to build a system capable of multi-step reasoning, planning, and execution – precisely the prompting techniques we’ll master.\nWhy is a single, simple prompt often insufficient for guiding an LLM through a complex or multi-step task? Correct! A single prompt is like giving a single instruction, whereas complex tasks require an ongoing dialogue. To act like an “experienced senior developer,” the AI needs to be guided through a process of breaking down the problem, investigating, and integrating information—steps that require a sequence of prompts to manage the plan and its execution effectively.\nThink about a complex, multi-step project you’ve recently worked on, either personally or professionally. This could be anything from planning a detailed event, to troubleshooting a tricky problem at home or work, or even tackling a challenging creative endeavor.\nFoundational Understanding of LLMs: You should know what a Large Language Model (LLM) is at a conceptual level, including its general capabilities (e.g., text generation, understanding) and the basic idea of using “prompts” to interact with it.\nBriefly describe the project and list 3-4 distinct steps you had to take to move it forward.\nNow, imagine you were trying to get a standard AI assistant (like a basic chatbot) to complete the entire project for you using only a single request or prompt.\nBased on your experience with AI, at which specific step do you predict the AI would most likely fail, misunderstand, or give a generic, unhelpful response? Why do you think that particular step would be the breaking point for a single-prompt approach?\n\nprobabilistic In the context of interacting with a Large Language Model (LLM), what is a ‘prompt’?\n\nThe input text or instructions probide to guide its response Large Language Model (LLM)? A ML model trained on the vast amounts of text data to understand, sumamrize , generate and predict context\nThroughout this course, you’ll explore:\nThe world of AI Agents, understanding their core components and how they reason, plan, and interact with their digital environments.\n\nThe art and science of advanced prompting techniques, mastering how to instruct LLMs with precision and nuance.\n\nCrafting specialized personas using role-based prompting to make AI outputs more targeted and contextually relevant.\n\nUnlocking problem-solving abilities using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to guide the LLM's reasoning process and ReAct (Reason + Act) to enable LLMs to use tools and take actions.\n\nThe process of prompt instruction refinement, learning to systematically analyze and adjust your prompts for optimal performance.\n\nBuilding multi-step agentic workflows by chaining prompts together, allowing AI to tackle more complex tasks.\n\nPrompt Chaining & Feedback Loops: Building robust, multi-step workflows that allow an AI to tackle complex tasks and even improve its own work based on feedback.\nEnd of Course Project: Agentsville Trip Planner\nAt the end of the course, you’ll attempt to build the “Agentsville Trip Planner Assistant” project, a smart agent that can take a complex request and see it through to completion. This is your opportunity to see just how powerful prompting can be in agentic AI. You will apply all of the individual skills you learned to create a truly capable system.\nWe want to wish you the very best of luck! You’re about to start a journey to harness the incredible power of Large Language Models. Get ready to move beyond basic interactions and learn how to architect and guide AI.\nBy the end of this journey, you will have acquired the skills to:\nExplain AI systems that utilize LLMs for sophisticated reasoning and planning capabilities.\nMaster a range of advanced prompting strategies to elicit precise behavior and information from LLMs.\nSystematically optimize and refine your prompts, transforming general AI responses into highly specific and useful outputs.\nConstruct multi-step AI workflows that can handle complex, real-world challenges.\nImplement mechanisms for validation and iterative improvement, leading to more reliable AI agents.\nUltimately, transform generic Large Language Models into specialized, powerful tools tailored to solve intricate problems across various domains.\nThis course will both challenge you and equip you with the cutting-edge skills needed to innovate in the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence. We’re excited to see what you’ll learn and, eventually, what you’ll build. Good luck!"

Yes, statistics and data skills can take some time to learn; but with the right method, they don’t have to be daunting. It is up to the educator to find a way that benefits the most students. An observation is that many researchers do not know or remember advanced math; yet do they need advanced math to grasp many fundamental statistical concepts?\nI believe that it is far more important and useful to teach basic IT skills and exploratory data analysis so that students can develop an understanding of their own data; rather than using a test blindly."

    "section": "Rebooting MF9130E classroom",
    "text": "Rebooting MF9130E classroom\nWhen I heard that the teaching team at Biostatistics Department, Faculty of Medicine was thinking about trying a novel pedagogical method on the MF9130E (2023 spring) class, I was more than excited to contribute. This is a PhD level course of 8 days long, offered three times a year (twice in Norwegian language). Students come from a variey of backgrounds in health and life sciences. Since this is an introductory course, the topics are broad rather than specialised.\nA few years ago, statistical software for the course made the transition from SPSS to Stata. To be more precise, students were introduced to, but not really explained to, or elaborated on how to use Stata proficiently. Why? The course is about statistics so only statistics is taught. Data skills such as manipulation are not part of statistics. \nWell, we will change that by starting to use R.\n\nThree open source musketeers\nR, quarto and GitHub the three musketeers in facilitating the transformation. We build a quarto course website where all the material are public, hosted with GitHub Pages. Having a course website is beneficial for students to have an overview of the course, in contrast to many scattered lecture notes and exercises to be downloaded.\nThe biggest advantage of using quarto is the rendered output from code. From a student’s perspective, it is reassuring to see the same result and plots using the data and code provided by the instructor. For the instructor, it is also convenient to see whether the code functions as expected. When we do not want to show the output, it is also very easy to suppress. We have created one copy with and one withtout rendered output as exercises, and are glad to see some students challenging themselves by attempting to solve the problems without solution.\nUsing Github and quarto together to build a course website is rather straightforward. I think the site structure is simple yet flexible enough to navigate. Collaboration across a small teaching team is also manageable. Github Pages was easy to set up, and changes made on the main branch is deployed within the minute. This proved to be useful in quite a few moments (where we had to replace some datasets or add some notice).\n\n\nThe Carpentries pedagogical model\nThe Carpentries is an organisation that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. I myself benefited from their workshop on version control and git taught at University of Oslo, and I think the traditional classroom could use some of the methods at these data science workshops.\nTo put simply, there are two things I tried with the course setup for MF9130E:\n\nLive coding demonstration, plenty of it\nSticky-notes flag and helper (teaching assistant) in class\n\nIn the live coding demonstration (which I was responsible for), I made sure that students were taught the most commonly used R commands for data manipulation and exploration. Quarto webpages on introduction to R, basic EDA, intermediate EDA have been created and guided through in class, mixed with statistical concepts and visualizations. Without knowing how your data looks like, blindly using statistical tests is dangerous - that is the motivation for doing so.\nWhether students feel supported can make a huge difference in their willingness to learn. Taking it slow at the beginning, and solve the problems on an individual basis can prevent early drop-outs, especially when programming and IT systems are involved. Naturally, when we don’t have helpers we can not help everyone; this is a limitation for this model. Students should be encouraged to help each other.\n\n\nLet them explore\nThe last important change in the class was to give time to students themselves. We reduced the lecturing on theory and computation, and added time for practice and discussion. The guided practice with live demo also came with solution and comments, so students could explore at their own pace. We left plenty of time for them to ask questions, and made sure most people can follow the exercises."

Student backgrounds are diverse, they work on lab data, clinical data or observational/epidemiological data:\n\nobservational study on humans 36%\nRCT 18%\nin vitro research 15%\nothers are in animal research, meta analysis or something else\n\nStatistical competency (method, software) among students are generally on the basic end. Over 75% of the cohort report themselves to have basic to very basic knowledge of statistics; 33% do not use any statistical software, around 45% have used SPSS or Stata. On the other hand, some students (7%) report to have advanced knowledge and have some R experience.\n\nSome feedback\nThis is the first time we do the course with R, live demo and put an emphasis on basic data manipulation and exploration - which means we do not have enough data, it is just an initial impression.\nHere’s what we have received. On the positive side, 86% find the course useful for their own PhD research. 75% felt they are able to use the correct methods for their analyses, which is quite encouraging. Most felt the examples and exercises were able to demonstrate the theory. Students have generally positive experience with the live demo, and find the instructors supportive. This is good!\nIn the meantime, it is only natural that some are dissatisfied (21%) in some ways. Common complaints are: R is not user friendly to absolute beginners; the leap from no software to a programming language is too big for some.\nAs for whether students have really mastered the knowledge intended, we do not have enough data to draw a conclusion. We do observe that the take home project show somewhat better understanding, but can not say for sure just yet.\nThis is a class with very diverse backgrounds, hence it is challenging to cater to everyone’s needs. Yet, we are satisfied with the trial-transformation with our introductory statistics class, and we plan to gradually implement more classes with R, and possibly hands-on practice (depending on capacity)."

    "text": "Hi there!\nI am a researcher focused on developing intelligent, secure, and adaptable AI systems for next-generation cyber-physical infrastructure. My work spans deep reinforcement learning (DRL), multi-agent systems, large language models (LLMs), safe and explainable AI, computer vision, and robotics, with real-world applications in smart energy systems, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure.\nThe core of my Ph.D. research centers on developing physics-informed and safety-critical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks that embed domain knowledge and system constraints directly into the learning process. By incorporating physical laws, safety boundaries, and system dynamics into policy optimization, I design agents capable of making robust, interpretable, and reliable decisions in dynamic, high-stakes environments. My work addresses challenges such as uncertainty quantification, adversarial resilience, and safe exploration, while enabling agents to generalize across diverse network topologies, environmental conditions, and task distributions through advanced transfer learning and meta-learning techniques.\nI also leverage the CARLA simulator for autonomous driving research, combining computer vision, trajectory planning, and policy learning in complex traffic environments. My work integrates vision-based perception models for object detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion, enabling robust situational awareness for autonomous agents. In parallel, I integrate LLM-based reasoning into simulation and control frameworks to support high-level planning, adaptive decision-making, and interactive human-AI collaboration for robotics and safety-critical control.\nBeyond autonomous and energy systems, my broader research interests include probabilistic modeling, statistical machine learning, and developing AI systems that are robust, trustworthy, and deployable in real-world complex environments.\nOther Research Interests:\n\nComputer Vision: Visual perception, object detection, semantic segmentation, sensor fusion for autonomous systems.\nSoftware Systems: Scalable software engineering, simulation framework development, real-time systems integration.\nStatistical Machine Learning: Uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, data-driven inference in dynamic environments.\nRobotics: Learning-based control, adaptive planning, safe human-robot interaction, multi-modal robotic systems.\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Jan 2025]\n\n\nOur paper on Transfer Learning Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Volt-Var Control in Smart Grids has been accepted to IEEE PES Grid Edge Technologies Conference & Exposition 2025.\n\n\n\n\n[Aug 2024]\n\n\nOur paper on Workshop for High Performance Computing has been accepted at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center 2024.\n\n\n\n\n[Jul 2024]\n\n\nOur paper on Bayesian Optimization for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Robust Volt-Var Control has been accepted to IEEE PES General Meeting 2024.\n\n\n\n\n[Nov 2023]\n\n\nOur paper Deep RL-based Volt-VAR Control and Attack Resiliency for DER-Integrated Distribution Grids was accepted to IEEE ISGT 2024.\n\n\n\n\n[Aug 2022]\n\n\nParticipated in the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School, completing tracks in MLx Health and MLx Finance.\n\n\n\n\n[Apr 2022]\n\n\nOur paper on Pattern-Based Multivariate Regression using Deep Learning (PBMR-DP) was accepted to ICMLA 2022."

To optimize the climate benefits of the program, we developed the Washington Climate Smart Estimator {WaCSE} using R and Shiny.\nIntegrating national climate models and datasets, this intuitive, regionally specific user interface allows farmers and policymakers to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across Washington’s diverse counties and farm sizes. Users can explore GHG estimates in interactive tables and plots, download results in spreadsheets and figures, and generate PDF reports. In this talk, we present the development process of {WaCSE} and discuss the lessons we learned from creating our first ever Shiny app.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\n\n\nRecording\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{ryan2023,\n  author = {Ryan, Jadey and Michel, Leslie and Gelardi, Dani},\n  title = {Shiny Optimization of Climate Benefits from a Statewide\n    Agricultural Grant Program},\n  date = {2023-08-19},\n  url = {https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/2023-08-19_cascadia_shiny-wacse/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRyan, Jadey, Leslie Michel, and Dani Gelardi. 2023. “Shiny\nOptimization of Climate Benefits from a Statewide Agricultural Grant\nProgram.” August 19, 2023. https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/2023-08-19_cascadia_shiny-wacse/."

In the last decade, more tools and models have been developed to consider the interactive effects of chemicals within a mixture when conducting risk assessments. Therefore, this study uses actual environmental concentrations measured in 2018 and 2019 from the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s Surface Water Monitoring Program. Aquatic risk from exposure was assessed from chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion (as individual chemicals and as binary and ternary mixtures) using the concentration addition model. These pesticides were selected because they have a common mechanism of toxicity, are frequently detected in surface waters in Washington, and were recently evaluated in a biological opinion by the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nAll detected concentrations of chlorpyrifos and malathion, assessed as individual chemicals, exceeded the predicted no effect concentration, indicating potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. Further, risk quotients for all binary and ternary mixtures were greater than one, also indicative of potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. In all samples containing a mixture, the maximum cumulative ratio suggested that a single insecticide contributed &gt;50% of the overall toxicity of each mixture. Based on the individual and mixture risk quotients, chlorpyrifos and malathion were the primary drivers of the toxicity of each mixture.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!

The climate change mitigation potential of different on-farm practices depends on many site-specific factors such as geography, climate, soil type, and management history.\nTo maximize the climate change mitigation potential of the SFF program, and to optimize the use of every dollar, a decision support tool is required. This presentation demonstrates how two existing spatial datasets (NRCS’ COMET-Planner and WSDA’s Agricultural Land Use) can be integrated into a decision support tool using ArcGIS Dashboards and Experience Builder. This tool, called the Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE), allows users to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across different counties in Washington.\nBy utilizing the intuitive user interface of ArcGIS Dashboards, WaCSE enables swift, science-based estimates of climate benefits, while remaining accessible for audiences of varied technical backgrounds.\nSee the old app built with ArcGIS.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!

    "section": "",
    "text": "Github as a platform\n\nOn contribution\nNearly half of all contributors only contributed once; which accounted for less than 2% of total commits.\nThe pattern that one or a few developers do most of the work, followed by many casual contributors and even more passive users is the norm, not exception in open source.\nOn casual contributors: they primarily see themselves as users of the project, rather than a part of a contributor community.\nChallenge for maintainers: not how to get more contributors, but how to manage high volume of frequent, low-touch interactions (directing air traffic)\n\nGithub’s open source developers have more in common with solo creators on Twitter, Instagram, YouTube or Twitch.\n\nComparing early internet and social platform nowadays: the early online communities have mailing lists, online forums, membership groups, operated like villages that have their own culture, history and norms. Nowadays creators have much bigger potential audience but the relationship is one-sided, and can be overwhelming.\n\n\nOn free software and hacker\n“Free” means you are able to do what you want with the software, rather than the cost. Libre rather than gratis. At least at the beginning.\nBravado, showmanship, mischievousness, deep mistrust of authority. This culture in the 1980s and 90s was closely linked to the early open source software.\n“Bazaar”: highly participatory, versus “Cathedral”: restricted to a smaller group\nToday’s developer hardly even notice “open source” as a concept anymore, they just want to write and publish their code. They prioritize convenience over freedom or openness.\n\n\nOn licensing\nThe widespread use of permissive licensing is popularized by GH.\nCopyleft licensing (e.g. GNU General Public License GPL) is not commercial friendly as it requires companies to license their software that depend on open source GPL software to have the same license. However GPL gives developers more control over how others use their code in the long run.\n\nAs with any other online content today, sharing is the default.\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of an open source software\n\nOn how projects evolve\nCreate -&gt; Promote and distribute -&gt; Grow\nProjects are promoted like a founder would promote a startup: share on the relevant channels online, give talks at conference and meetups, encourage others to write and talk about it\nA sign that the software is used widely: when the maintainer starts doing more non-code (triage issues, review pull requests) rather than code work.\n\n\nContributor and users\nDepends on technical scope (whether there is much to do), support required (code and admin work), ease of participation (whether on Github) and user adoption (potential contributor base).\nFour types of projects\n\nhigh user growth, high contributor growth: federations. Rare, impactful, the ‘ideal’ of open source project. Roughly 3% of open source projects. Examples: Rust, Node.js, Linux\nhigh user growth, low contributor growth: stadiums: powered by one or a few developers. Centralized.\nlow user growth, high contributor growth: club. Similar to meetup or hobby groups, do not have a wide reach but are loved and built by enthusiasts.\nlow user growth, low contributor growth: toys. Personal project, isn’t trying to grow its user base. Projects on Github with less than 10 stars. Authors do not expect to receive contributions nor do they care about whether people are watching.\n\nDecentralized communities (clubs and federations) have the potential for high user growth - recruit new contributors, reduce contribution friction.\nCentralized communities (stadium) depends on the creators to manage user demand - automation, elimination of noise\n\n\n\nRoles, incentives and relationships\n\nFirms or communities\nFirms (companies, organizations): centralized resources; from a coordination standpoint, managing resources would be more efficient within the same organization - which does not explain why open source developers make software together without formal contracts and financial compensation.\n\n\nThe commons and peer production\nTragedy of the commons: resources depleted by people acting in their own self-interest rather than in the collective interest.\n(One of the 8 design principles by Ostrom on) successful commons:\n\nThose who are affecteed by the rules can participate in modifying them.\n\nStrong sense of group identity maks rules, dispute resolution more meaningful.\nCoordination cost is lower when self-organized based on who wants to do the work most, anyone can do the advertised work and volunteer.\nIn contrast, in companies - solicit, evaluate, hire, manage employees; only employees can do the work limited by their job functions.\nPeople collaborating online for no obvious reason beyond personal satisfaction (intrinsic motivation)\nModular and granular tasks: how tasks are organized, and how big each task is.\nLow coordination costs: quality control over thee modules, integrate the contributions into the finished product\n\n\nContribution beyond code\nSome users do not consider them a contributor, but do actually contribute by education, spreading the word, support (forum), bug reports and more.\nThese active users are similar to contributors but operate independently from project’s contributor community.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{zhang2024,\n  author = {Zhang, Chi},\n  title = {Working in {Public:} {The} {Making} and {Maintenance} of\n    {Open} {Source} {Software} - {Nadia} {Eghbal}},\n  date = {2024-02-18},\n  url = {https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/readnotes_20240218_open_source/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nZhang, Chi. 2024. “Working in Public: The Making and Maintenance\nof Open Source Software - Nadia Eghbal.” February 18, 2024. https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/readnotes_20240218_open_source/."

    "text": "The IBS (International Biometric Society) conference of the Central European Network, CEN2023 has been a great opportunity to keep myself up to date with the latest development of biostatistics, both in academia and industry. Thanks to the great effort made by the organizing committee and almighty Google Meet/Zoom, I have been able to follow the talks without any issue, and have definitely learned a lot.\nGiven my background, I paid more attention on talks and workshops on\n\nStatistical software, R programming and simulation\nCausal inference\n\nThere were also two topics that drew my attention: one is on statistical education towards medial professionals, the other is on a Data Challenge using RCT data.\n\nStatistical software\n\nSoftware Engineering Working Group (SWE WG), MMRM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Sabanes Bove (Roche). First year of the Software Engineering working group - working together across organizations\nGonzalo Duran-Pacheco (Roche). Comparing R libraries with SAS’s PROC MIXED for the analysis of longitudinal continuous endpoints using MMRM\n\n\n\n\nThe ASA Biopharmaceutical Section (BIOP) Software Engineering Working Group SWE WG was established in 2022. Currently they have 3 work streams:\n\nmmrm implements MMRM (mixed models with repeated measures)\nbrms.mmrm, the Bayesian version of MMRM\nHealth Technology Assessment with R\n\nAt a later talk, mmrm was compared with SAS’s PROC MIXED and R’s nlme, glmmTMB for analyses of longitudinal continuous endpoints. In terms of speed and convergence, mmrm is superior than others; while the estimate prodouced by mmrm is very close to PROC MIXED and glmmTMB.\nThis looks like a very interesting tool to try out! Vignette\n\n\nSimulation tools and RWD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Kammer (Medical University of Vienna). An overview of R software tools to support simulation studies: towards standardizing coding practices.\n\n\n\n\nKammer and colleagues did a review on R packages for simulation, and selected 14 top simulation packages, including simstudy, simdata, synthpop, bigsimr and others. The full list is made available here.\nA real-world dataset, NHANES was also introduced here. The data can be accessed with R package nhanesA.\n\n\n\nCausal Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop: Implementing the estimand framework in global drug development: Application of causal inference approaches (Mouna Akacha, Björn Bornkamp, Alex Ocampo, Jiawei Wei at Novartis)\nKeynote: Ruth Keogh (LSHTM). Causal inference with observational data: A survival guide\n\n\n\nThese two workshop / talk cover slightly different scenarios: one in RCT, one for observational data. It deserves a whole article or more to elaborate on this topic, so I’m only putting some resources here.\nCausal inference is definitely gaining traction in recent years in both academia and industry. Techniques such as g-computation, IPW and doubly robust estimation are starting to become mainstream. It is fascinating that these techniques themselves are not bound to a fixed model.\nResources:\n\nWorkshop repository Causal-inference-in-RCTs\nBook: Causal Inference: What If by Hernán and Robins (2020)\nPrincipal stratum strategy, Bornkamp et al. (2021)\nTime-dependent covariates, Keogh et al. (2023)\nTarget Trial Emulation (TTE), Hernán and Robins (2016)\n\n\n\nCovariate adjustment and data challenge with RCT data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Van Lancker (Ghent University). Improving Power in Randomized Trials by Leveraging Baseline Variables\nDominic Magirr (Novartis). Organizing a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\nCraig Wang (Novartis). Participating in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\n\nPanel discussion: Jonathan Bartlett (LSHTM)\n\n\n\n23 teams at Novartis participated in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment. They were given a fixed outcome model, and 5 prior studies trial data, and their task was to create the design matrices that improve the precision compared to unadjusted data.\nIf I were to select talks based on the category titles, I would probably missed the whole session. However, it is surprisingly similar to using not trial, but real-world data (such as EHR) to make predictions. The conclusion were similar as well: using “supercovariates” created by ML isn’t gaining much compared to simple models such as ANCOVA. Possible reasons:\n\nsmall to moderate data size\nlinear relationship between covariates and outcome\ngood enough prognostic variables\n\nIt was also mentioned that the winning team did some trick to reduce the variance among the covariates. Would be interesting to read about it.\nSome resources:\n\nLancker et al. The use of covariate adjustment in randomized controlled trials: an overview link\nCovariate adjustment tutorial, link\n\n\n\nStatistical education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaren Vens et al (University of Lübeck). Biostatistics/Biometrics for physicians – essential or unnecessary? How do practicing physicians and dentists evaluate biostatistics? A cross-sectional survey\n\n\n\n\nStatistical education to students / professionals who are not used to working with data has always been tricky. Students generally think statistics is difficult, and need help from a statistician. However there are only limited number of statisticians. The talk by Vens and colleagues confirms what practicing statisticians know, but can’t do much about: most (87%) physicians and dentists in the survey need a statistician to help with their work.\nHow to improve the statistical competency is an important and relevant topic for discussion, and might require systematic changes in how it is taught. Use of modern technology can help, yet it’s only helpful when students start to not fear, or not find math and technology boring.\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{zhang2023,\n  author = {Zhang, Chi},\n  title = {Personal {Highlights:} {CEN2023}},\n  date = {2023-09-06},\n  url = {https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/blog_20230904_cen2023/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nZhang, Chi. 2023. “Personal Highlights: CEN2023.” September\n6, 2023. https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/blog_20230904_cen2023/."

Even though the course focuses on clinical reporting in the pharmaceutical industry, the practices are highly relevant in other sectors as well (e.g. public health, academia, other industries that use open-source software).\nSpecific statistical methods, packages are introduced only at a high-level; which means the course is not for learning how to use this or that packages; but good practice guidelines.\nIn my opinion,\n\nit would be useful if the learner has some experience with software development and/or statistics; otherwise learners might not know how to practice them.\nmost of the examples are related to R packages (understandable), so some experience with R package (use or develop) is useful.\nit could be a very good study material for university students in related subjects.\n\n\n\n\nModule 1 (notes): what the requirements are regarding clinical reporting, what should be done to meet the quality standards;\nModule 2 (notes): DevOps and Agile\nModule 3 (notes): version Control, git workflows, reproducible clinical reporting\nModule 4 (notes): code quality, robust and reusable code, R packages\nModule 5 (notes): risk management with open source software\n\n\n\n\nI have a few years of experience as an R developer and academic researcher in related fields, so not all concepts are new to me.

    "text": "Quarto as a teaching tool\n\nFrom personal to workshop website\nI switched from blogdown to Quarto in late 2022, right after my PhD. It was initially a cure for a severe burnout from a combination of work-related stressors, when I desperately needed something other than research. My mental state was like the famous painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experience of the switch was explained in the previously mentioned blog. Briefly, it was light like a feather. Since I was quite satisfied, I thought, why don’t I make a workshop website? So I did.\nThe result was quite good, I made the (as far as I knew) first quarto workshop website at University of Oslo for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2022. Feedback from students were positive, and the instructor team thought it hosts the material in a more organized way.\n\n\nSingle day workshop -&gt; two week course\nI was greatly encouraged by the experience, so when I got a 50% position at University of Oslo as biostatistics lecturer, I thought, why don’t we have the same thing for the course?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh well, the workload is crushing. There were a few key differences:\n\nR scripts and material were unavailable since the course was originally in STATA. Everything need to be done from scratch, for at least 12 lab sessions;\nThe students generally have little IT skills, which means more effort need to be done to guide them through the ‘get started’ part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took one month to create the first version of the website. More details about the experience can be read here.\n\n\nAdding WebR to the course\nOne year later, as technology advances, we added new content to some parts of the website. Most notably is the interactivity achieved through WebR. For example, I made this page on randomness and statistical distribution where students can interactively modify code chunks in a web browser."

Strictly speaking, webRand quarto are not R per se. However, they’ve become the gateway drugs for R programmers to dabble in WebDev. With web assembly (wasm), now one can execute R code in a browser and even run shiny app.\nUnlock the power of dataViz animation and interactivity in quarto by Deepsha Menghani used a super fun example (F-bomb) to demonstrate how to add interactivity to your barplot (or other plots) with Crosstalk. Check out the talk here. The presentation was as interactive as the quarto slides, good job Deepsha!\nRunning shiny without a server by Joe Cheng (repo): this was a big announcement. I used shiny at work, but for my own projects or smaller teaching projects I tried to stay away from shiny - I was concerned about the fee. This looks like a promising thing to try out once it’s stable, although I’d probably do webR first."

It is very inspiring to see so many cool tables that makes you wonder, “is it really JUST a table?” For example, check out this gallery by Posit community.\nThe book Creating beautiful tables in R with gt by Albert Rapp would be a good place to learn how to make nice tables. Actually the reason why I wanted to use gt is that it seems to be the mainsteam in clinical reporting in pharma. I bumped into this blog post some time ago, and this would be my starting point.\n\n\nQuarto\nIf you want to go one step further and start making your quarto project pretty, there are a few things to try out.\nAlbert Rapp in his talk HTML and CSS for R Users stated that quarto is a gateway drug to WebDev. It reminds me of my very first presentation at my local R users community (2019) was about building a website with blogdown, and when I really spent a lot of time to make my markdown documentation colorful with span style - and that was about everything I knew.\nNow I want more. Learning HTML and CSS can make your dataviz, tables, slides and dashboards look not only professional but also special. I’m going to check out the scss variables in quarto which defines the theme, theme_file.scss. Emil Hvitfeldt (Styling and templating quarto documents) showed us how to make really pretty and animated (!) quarto sldies themes, and shared this template with us, quarto-revealjs-earth. I really like how revealjs slides look like, just that the MacOS Keynote (or MS ppt) drag-and-drop seems more flexible to me (?) Guess it’s something I should get used to over time.\nRichard Iannone (Extending quarto) introduced quarto shortcode extensions to add a bunch of fancy-looking icons to quarto files. To create extensions in general: https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/creating. This is for more pro-users since you needs to learn lua."

    "title": "Open source reporting with R: clinical, public health, RSE and embrace the change",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Two days ago (Jan 11 2023) I watched a presentation by data scientists at Roche about why they are making their clinical trials in 2023 open source with R. As someone who uses R for most of the time and has done similar works (not in pharma, but in public health surveillance and reporting: watch my talk, slides to find out what we do), I watched the presentation with great interest. Here are my notes, combined with some thoughts on open-source in the industry, public sector and academia.\n\nThree reasons for why I am writing this blog\n\nNote down some of the technology which points towards the future of the field\nRelate to my experience of open-source applied in public health, specifically public health reporting\nShare some thoughts in statistical education of applied students/researchers (e.g. medicine), and training Research Software Engineers\n\n\n\nMy experience with statistical software\nTo put my opinions in perspective,\n\nI do not have experience with SAS or pharma, so I do not have first-hand knowledge on the functionality, ease-of-use or the popularity of commercial softwares in the industry.\nI did my MSc and PhD in statistics/biostatistics/medical informatics and R had always been a default choice.\nI worked in public health for a few years, where Excel is possibly the most common tool, and STATA and R are scarcely used (statisticians, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians).\nIn the past few years, my university has made the switch from SPSS to STATA for intro statistics for medical students (while students at higher level, or doing advanced analyses might use R/python), and a test-run with R might be in motion.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Reporting\nIn drug development at pharmaceutical companies (and/or research institutes and hospitals), these data related tasks are very common:\n\nsummarise safety and efficacy data\nprovide accurate picture of trial outcomes\nmanage data collection across different sites\n\nCompleting these tasks in a correct, efficient and reproducible manner is crucial for patient safety. However, these tasks are also highly resource intensive: highly trained scientist, statisticians and technincians must be involved in the process. Historically, pharma use commercial software such as SAS.\n\nRegulation and exploration needs\nThere are requirements for clinical reporting: both regulartory and exploratory. From the regulatory side, there exist industry standards (CDISC) in the clinical research process, such as SDTM (Model for Tabulation of Study Data) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model). Statistical analyses, tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) also fall into this cateogory.\nFrom the exploratory side, clinical data are highly context dependent, and new formats of data such as imaging are more and more used in prediction modeling and drug development.\nIn addition, it is not hard to imagine that the technical competency of employees differ, especially in large organizations. Enabling people with less experience to analyse trial data in a reproducible manner is helpful for not only the learning and growth of employees, but also the productivity of organizations.\nThe existing commercial tools are not able to adapt to the rapid changes in the field.\n\n\nTransition into Open-Source\nIn this talk, Dr Kieran Martin at Roche introduced that they started using R as their core data science tool, aiming to move their codebase to having a core R. In the future, they plan to have something that is lanugage agnostic: meaning that python, Stan, C++, Julia and beyond can be used for different tasks.\nI only noted down a few of the things they mentioned on the infrastructure side:\n\nOCEAN - a lanugage agnostic computing platform on AWS (docker)\nGit, Gitlab for version control and collaboration\nRstudio connect server\nSnakemake for orchestrate production\n\n\n\nR and Shiny\nThere are obvious benefits of using R. It is convenient to install and use (if you used python and R, you’d probably agree), and the latest development in Shiny made it very easy to develop interactive visualizations, suitable for exploration. Package development is critical for reproducibility and distributing works - which R does it very well. A few packages developed by pharma are Teal and admiral: the ADaM in R, which I intend to check out at one point.\nR has deep roots in academia which means the newest statistical methods are well covered; which also affects the skill sets that talents own - fresh graduates probably already learned it at university. R being open source means that collaboration with external partners is much more efficient, and transparent. Strong community support is another positive thing that encourages beginners to enter the field and learn.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Public Health\n\nSurveillance and reporting\nOne key functionality of public health (PH) authorities is stay informed and inform. They collect data from labs, hospitals and clinics across the country, summarize into useful statistics in tables and graphs, make reports, then inform the policy makers to make decisions (such as vaccination campaigns).\nCompared to clinical reporting (in my understanding), there are many similarities - we make TLG (tables, listings and graphs). There are also features that make reporting in public health unique:\n\nPH surveillance and reporting are dynamic and real-time, which can change in a matter of days. That is because the situation of different infectious diseases can evolve rapidly, so PH authorities need to make appropriate adjustments.\nTime and location (spatial-temporal) are important. Different time granularity (daily, weekly) and geographical units (nation, county, municipality, city districts) are typically required for reporting.\n\n\n\nScale up and automate with open source tools\nTraditionally, these reports are made manually - one location, one graph per time on a certain disease. When a global pandemic hits, this is definitely not fast enough. At my team (Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health), we tried a different approach. Details of what we did can be found in this talk(slides), but to make it brief:\n\nWe developed a fully automated pipeline that connects 15 registries (vaccination, lab, hospital and intensive care and many more). The data is gathered, censored, cleaned and pre-processed for down-stream analysis\nStatistical analysis, tables, graphs and maps are made for all locations in Norway for various outcomes of interest, such as Covid, influenza, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nOver 1000 customized reports with over 30 graphs and tables are produced daily and sent to local PH officials, where we also had a shiny website (Kommunehelsetjenester for Kommunelege) for over 300 PH officials to get most up-to-date information about their own municipality\n\nBy automation, every year Sykdomspulsen can save 700 000 NOK (roughly 70k USD) while making 400 times more real-time reports for public health. Even better, with reproducibility and quality control.\n\n\nToolbox\nSykdomspulsen is a small team (8 people, 3 are statisticians and 1 engineer), and our infrastructure was built upon R packages, which we call splverse. Our infrastructure is not fundamentally different from the one Roche introduced, basically:\n\nR does the task planning and project organization. On top of this, the data cleaning, statistical analysis are implemented. Graphs, tables and maps are made with appropriate R packages\nRmarkdown does automated reporting into .docx and .xlsx. Some reports are also in .html tables to be embedded into customized emails\nRstudio Workbench and GitHub help with teamwork\n\nDocker, GoCD and Airflow do the CI/CD and orchestration\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the transition\n\nCulture change needed\nUnfortunately, not all organizations are eager to abandon the old way. Even at our own institute where researchers are the majority, open source and modern day programming is hardly practiced (by my observation). Even worse, under the budget cuts in 2023-24, a large number of younger employees who have the technical skills have left - which left the public health surveillance even more vulnerable now that Covid is far from over.\nIn my opinion, public health needs open-source and good programming even more than pharmaceutical companies. Both save lifes - and PH has less money to invest in softwares, infrastructures and talents. In this situation, resources should be spent in fields that are critical and most cost-effective; yet in reality this is often not the case.\nThe slow culture change at big organizations can happen, but only if there is a sufficient amount of employees who are willing to embrace the new technology. In the talk by Roche they about about their training strategy. It is not possible to train all users, and not everyone has the same needs at the same time. Therefore, self study with certain study paths is encouraged and supported.\n\n\nTeach programming to students in various fields\nBased on my experience in the UK and Norway, students (myself included) learn R programming in one of the two ways\n\nLearning by Googling (self-taught): a university degree needs to use it: provides a short introduction, then students learn by using. This is how I learned R at my MSc Statistics degree, and this is probably the most common way\nWorkshops at university: organizations such as the Carpentries provide course material and teaching a few times per year, where interested students (usually from subjects such as biology) come and learn. These classes are quite popular, and usually have a long waiting list.\n\nFrom learning by googling to some organized teaching - that is already some good progress. However, if not, can we improve?\nIn my experience with statistical advising with the university hospital, clinical researchers and medical students are enthusastic to get their statistics done, some are also eager to do some analysis themselves. That is good. Yet, there is generally lack of capacity - either knowledge or software skills. Once the statistician who helps with the project stops, the project ends. There is the need to have in-house statistical capacity. To this end, open-source softwares such as R, and good programming practice (reproducibility for example) can help a lot: the license doesn’t end, and everything is documented so that the next person can continue the work.\nI’m glad that my university has made some transitional efforts in this regard: STATA instead of SPSS is being taught to medical students as part of their statistics course. There might be a test-run in R soon, which is very exciting (since I’ll be involved in the teaching)!\n\n\nStatistical engineering and RSEs\nThat was the capacity building to get beginners more independent. On the other side, there is also the need for better programming practice for researchers at more advanced level. Research Software Engineering (RSE) is starting to get more and more attention, because it is not only relevant for research (i.e. getting papers published), but in broader applications.\nFor example, in the talk by Roche, they mentioned that “RSE teams need to accelerate adoption of new statistical methods and biomarker data analysis”, and the implementation with R packages and templates is at its core. In the future more languages would be included such as Python, Stan, C++ and Julia.\nHowever, RSE as a job title or career path is still a new thing. I know two RSEs at my university, and RSE is definitely not your typical academic faculty position: only departments that think it’s important makes positions, often not permanent. To get any new methods actually used in either industry or the public sector outside research, translating methods into tools is must-do. In the future I hope RSE becomes a stable and common career path, and more exciting things can happen.\n\n\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{zhang2023,\n  author = {Zhang, Chi},\n  title = {Open Source Reporting with {R:} Clinical, Public Health,\n    {RSE} and Embrace the Change},\n  date = {2023-01-13},\n  url = {https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/blog_20230112_roche_opensource/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nZhang, Chi. 2023. “Open Source Reporting with R: Clinical, Public\nHealth, RSE and Embrace the Change.” January 13, 2023. https://kundan-kumarr.github.io/blog/talks/blog_20230112_roche_opensource/."

    "section": "Time to try Quarto",
    "text": "Time to try Quarto\nNow that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks in October 2022, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!\nThere were quite a lot of discussions about Quarto in the summer 2022. I wasn’t following the discussions closely, but I remember there were quite a few talks in the Rstudio conference this year. Then more and more people switched to Quarto on Twitter. Then people I know also switched to Quarto. What’s the fuzz about?\nMy experience with Quarto is focused on websites. I have not tried other forms of publishing. So far I have created:\n\na workshop website for my colleagues\na personal website (the one you are reading right now)\nan R package (qtwAcademic)that wraps three Quarto website templates for beginners\n\nHere are a few things I like about Quarto. Given that I’m not very experienced in front-end development, these comments are going to be about ease-of-use and design, rather than the technicalities.\n\nClean look for both personal and workshop/courses\nWhen I was using “academic” template in blogdown, I liked the structure of the site: projects, talks, blog, softwares and publications sections are clearly displayed at the top. What I didn’t like is that the default homepage was a very long single page; yet its customisation wasn’t the easist. Other templates were either too simple (for blog only), or more suitable for image display (photography projects). I wanted a website that keep the good structure of “academic”, which is quite suitable for academics (hence the name); while keeping each section independent.\nWith distill I could achieve the structure I wanted; but I didn’t enjoy it too much as a personal website (at least it wasn’t as flexible as Quarto). distill is still pretty decent for organisations or documentation site.\nWith Quarto, I can achieve the desired looks for not only a personal website (with or without blogs), but also a workshop, event or even course website. This is fantastic! The top, sidebar or hybrid navigation makes the site structure very clear, especially when there are lots of content. As an aspiring lecturer at university, this is really One Quarto Rules Them All.\n\n\nFlexible yet not overwhelming\nAs I mentioned above, hacking “academic” in blogdown was not that easy - simply because there were too many folders that you are not actually supposed to modify. It was confusing to know what to change in order to achieve the desired output, and multiple folders were having the same names, making it very challenging for beginners. Ironically, this is usually the first template beginners start with!\nThat’s why I immediately fell for Quarto: you only need 4 components to make a decent minimalistic website work:\n\n_quarto.yml to control the overall layout\nindex.qmd at the root folder to control the homepage\nabout.qmd for some basic information about the creator or the website\nproject.qmd for projects or any other content that the creator wants to display\n\nThe way that _quarto.yml clearly specifies the .qmd files really helps beginners to understand where things are. This has been extremely useful for me when I wanted to learn how people made their website by reading the source code - I could understand exactly where to find the information I needed. The clear structure greatly helps the creators themselves, and also those who want to learn.\n\n\nGreat community\nRstats people have a great community. I wouldn’t be able to make my site the way I wanted if people haven’t been sharing their works. I have learned a lot by reading the source code by Dr Emi Tanaka, Dr David Schoch, Bea Milz, Prof Mine Cetinnkaya-Rundel’s STA 210 - Regression Analysis course.\nI also made my own R package that wraps three templates to create Quarto websites that are frequently used by academics, qtwAcademic. In the following days I plan to write up more detailed explanations on how to use the package, along with some new features."

Naturally, I advocate for more use of open source tools such as R/python in teaching introductory statistics to applied scientists. Nonetheless, how the material is taught will make a huge difference in the understanding and interest in the material.\nI was taught statistics in the classic way: lectures with tons of mathematical formulae and proofs, while programming and data analyses were left for students themselves to figure out. Those who were the fastest learners were the ones who already had a degree in computer science, which probably doesn’t sound surprising. I, for one, definitely struggled."

You must have met clinicians or biologists who would love their data to be analysed yet don’t know how to. Yes, statistics and data skills can take some time to learn; but with the right method, they don’t have to be daunting. It is up to the educator to find a way that benefits the most students. An observation is that many researchers do not know or remember advanced math; yet do they need advanced math to grasp many fundamental statistical concepts?\nI believe that it is far more important and useful to teach basic IT skills and exploratory data analysis so that students can develop an understanding of their own data; rather than using a test blindly."

This is a PhD level course of 8 days long, offered three times a year (twice in Norwegian language). Students come from a variey of backgrounds in health and life sciences. Since this is an introductory course, the topics are broad rather than specialised.\nA few years ago, statistical software for the course made the transition from SPSS to Stata. To be more precise, students were introduced to, but not really explained to, or elaborated on how to use Stata proficiently. Why? The course is about statistics so only statistics is taught. Data skills such as manipulation are not part of statistics. \nWell, we will change that by starting to use R.\n\nThree open source musketeers\nR, quarto and GitHub the three musketeers in facilitating the transformation. We build a quarto course website where all the material are public, hosted with GitHub Pages. Having a course website is beneficial for students to have an overview of the course, in contrast to many scattered lecture notes and exercises to be downloaded.\nThe biggest advantage of using quarto is the rendered output from code. From a student’s perspective, it is reassuring to see the same result and plots using the data and code provided by the instructor. For the instructor, it is also convenient to see whether the code functions as expected. When we do not want to show the output, it is also very easy to suppress. We have created one copy with and one withtout rendered output as exercises, and are glad to see some students challenging themselves by attempting to solve the problems without solution.\nUsing Github and quarto together to build a course website is rather straightforward. I think the site structure is simple yet flexible enough to navigate. Collaboration across a small teaching team is also manageable. Github Pages was easy to set up, and changes made on the main branch is deployed within the minute. This proved to be useful in quite a few moments (where we had to replace some datasets or add some notice).\n\n\nThe Carpentries pedagogical model\nThe Carpentries is an organisation that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. I myself benefited from their workshop on version control and git taught at University of Oslo, and I think the traditional classroom could use some of the methods at these data science workshops.\nTo put simply, there are two things I tried with the course setup for MF9130E:\n\nLive coding demonstration, plenty of it\nSticky-notes flag and helper (teaching assistant) in class\n\nIn the live coding demonstration (which I was responsible for), I made sure that students were taught the most commonly used R commands for data manipulation and exploration. Quarto webpages on introduction to R, basic EDA, intermediate EDA have been created and guided through in class, mixed with statistical concepts and visualizations. Without knowing how your data looks like, blindly using statistical tests is dangerous - that is the motivation for doing so.\nWhether students feel supported can make a huge difference in their willingness to learn. Taking it slow at the beginning, and solve the problems on an individual basis can prevent early drop-outs, especially when programming and IT systems are involved. Naturally, when we don’t have helpers we can not help everyone; this is a limitation for this model. Students should be encouraged to help each other.\n\n\nLet them explore\nThe last important change in the class was to give time to students themselves. We reduced the lecturing on theory and computation, and added time for practice and discussion. The guided practice with live demo also came with solution and comments, so students could explore at their own pace. We left plenty of time for them to ask questions, and made sure most people can follow the exercises."

    "text": "How did it go?\nAfter the 8 day course we carried out a small survey among the ~50 students in the spring 2023 class. Student backgrounds are diverse, they work on lab data, clinical data or observational/epidemiological data:\n\nobservational study on humans 36%\nRCT 18%\nin vitro research 15%\nothers are in animal research, meta analysis or something else\n\nStatistical competency (method, software) among students are generally on the basic end. Over 75% of the cohort report themselves to have basic to very basic knowledge of statistics; 33% do not use any statistical software, around 45% have used SPSS or Stata. On the other hand, some students (7%) report to have advanced knowledge and have some R experience.\n\nSome feedback\nThis is the first time we do the course with R, live demo and put an emphasis on basic data manipulation and exploration - which means we do not have enough data, it is just an initial impression.\nHere’s what we have received. On the positive side, 86% find the course useful for their own PhD research. 75% felt they are able to use the correct methods for their analyses, which is quite encouraging. Most felt the examples and exercises were able to demonstrate the theory. Students have generally positive experience with the live demo, and find the instructors supportive. This is good!\nIn the meantime, it is only natural that some are dissatisfied (21%) in some ways. Common complaints are: R is not user friendly to absolute beginners; the leap from no software to a programming language is too big for some.\nAs for whether students have really mastered the knowledge intended, we do not have enough data to draw a conclusion. We do observe that the take home project show somewhat better understanding, but can not say for sure just yet.\nThis is a class with very diverse backgrounds, hence it is challenging to cater to everyone’s needs. Yet, we are satisfied with the trial-transformation with our introductory statistics class, and we plan to gradually implement more classes with R, and possibly hands-on practice (depending on capacity)."

My work spans deep reinforcement learning (DRL), multi-agent systems, large language models (LLMs), safe and explainable AI, computer vision, and robotics, with real-world applications in smart energy systems, autonomous vehicles, and critical infrastructure.\nThe core of my Ph.D. research centers on developing physics-informed and safety-critical deep reinforcement learning (DRL) frameworks that embed domain knowledge and system constraints directly into the learning process. By incorporating physical laws, safety boundaries, and system dynamics into policy optimization, I design agents capable of making robust, interpretable, and reliable decisions in dynamic, high-stakes environments. My work addresses challenges such as uncertainty quantification, adversarial resilience, and safe exploration, while enabling agents to generalize across diverse network topologies, environmental conditions, and task distributions through advanced transfer learning and meta-learning techniques.\nI also leverage the CARLA simulator for autonomous driving research, combining computer vision, trajectory planning, and policy learning in complex traffic environments. My work integrates vision-based perception models for object detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion, enabling robust situational awareness for autonomous agents. In parallel, I integrate LLM-based reasoning into simulation and control frameworks to support high-level planning, adaptive decision-making, and interactive human-AI collaboration for robotics and safety-critical control.\nBeyond autonomous and energy systems, my broader research interests include probabilistic modeling, statistical machine learning, and developing AI systems that are robust, trustworthy, and deployable in real-world complex environments.\nOther Research Interests:\n\nComputer Vision: Visual perception, object detection, semantic segmentation, sensor fusion for autonomous systems.\nSoftware Systems: Scalable software engineering, simulation framework development, real-time systems integration.\nStatistical Machine Learning: Uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, data-driven inference in dynamic environments.\nRobotics: Learning-based control, adaptive planning, safe human-robot interaction, multi-modal robotic systems.\n\n\n\nNews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Jan 2025]\n\n\nOur paper on Transfer Learning Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Volt-Var Control in Smart Grids has been accepted to IEEE PES Grid Edge Technologies Conference & Exposition 2025.\n\n\n\n\n[Aug 2024]\n\n\nOur paper on Workshop for High Performance Computing has been accepted at Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center 2024.\n\n\n\n\n[Jul 2024]\n\n\nOur paper on Bayesian Optimization for Deep Reinforcement Learning in Robust Volt-Var Control has been accepted to IEEE PES General Meeting 2024.\n\n\n\n\n[Nov 2023]\n\n\nOur paper Deep RL-based Volt-VAR Control and Attack Resiliency for DER-Integrated Distribution Grids was accepted to IEEE ISGT 2024.\n\n\n\n\n[Aug 2022]\n\n\nParticipated in the Oxford Machine Learning Summer School, completing tracks in MLx Health and MLx Finance.\n\n\n\n\n[Apr 2022]\n\n\nOur paper on Pattern-Based Multivariate Regression using Deep Learning (PBMR-DP) was accepted to ICMLA 2022."

Outside of work, I love cooking and skating. 🛼\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Research Interests\n\n\n\n\nComputer Vision\n\n\nVisual perception, object detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion for autonomous systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical ML\n\n\nUncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, and data-driven inference in dynamic environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Driving Systems\n\n\nLearning-based control, trajectory planning, vision-based perception, and sensor fusion in autonomous driving environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore My Work\n\n\nBlog\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\nTalks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Dummy Talk\n\n\nLearning How to Show a Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\n\n\n\nNews Highlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Jul 2025]\n\n\nSelected for the Cohere Machine Learning Summer School, hosted by Cohere Labs.\n\n\n\n\n[Mar 2025]\n\n\nOur paper on Advanced Semi-Supervised Learning with Uncertainty Estimation for Phase Identification in Distribution Systems has been accepted to IEEE PES General Meeting 2025.\n\n\n\n\n[Jan 2025]\n\n\nOur paper on Transfer Learning Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Volt-Var Control in Smart Grids has been accepted to IEEE PES Grid Edge Technologies Conference & Exposition 2025."

    "text": "About the topic\nSituational awareness is key to fast response during a public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic. However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

    "text": "2024.7.8-11, Salzburg, Austria. Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

Sykdomspulsen processes new data collected from 15 data sources (e.g., covid-19 cases), runs 1000.000+ statistical analysis automatically for all locations (nation, county, municipality) in Norway, produces 1000+ reports and alerts for public health authorities and shares data to the public on GitHub.\nSykdomspulsen runs on a collection of R packages, the {splverse}. {splverse} is an ecosystem for infectious disease surveillance, from analysis planning, statistical analysis to reporting via visualization, shiny website and Rmarkdown generated reports. In this talk, Chi will present how Sykdomspulsen does public health real-time surveillance during the pandemic using R. Chi will introduce some of the core packages and illustrate how they work together, with an example using real surveillance data published daily on GitHub.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nChi is currently working at the Sykdomspulsen team as a researcher and R developer, at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Before she joined Sykdomspulsen in the middle of the pandemic (2020), she was a PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo (OCBE), working on hospital EHR data."

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.\nIn this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on ‘how’ to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

The climate change mitigation potential of different on-farm practices depends on many site-specific factors such as geography, climate, soil type, and management history.\nTo maximize the climate change mitigation potential of the SFF program, and to optimize the use of every dollar, a decision support tool is required. This presentation demonstrates how two existing spatial datasets (NRCS’ COMET-Planner and WSDA’s Agricultural Land Use) can be integrated into a decision support tool using ArcGIS Dashboards and Experience Builder. This tool, called the Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE), allows users to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across different counties in Washington.\nBy utilizing the intuitive user interface of ArcGIS Dashboards, WaCSE enables swift, science-based estimates of climate benefits, while remaining accessible for audiences of varied technical backgrounds.\nSee the old app built with ArcGIS.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!

In the last decade, more tools and models have been developed to consider the interactive effects of chemicals within a mixture when conducting risk assessments. Therefore, this study uses actual environmental concentrations measured in 2018 and 2019 from the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s Surface Water Monitoring Program. Aquatic risk from exposure was assessed from chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and malathion (as individual chemicals and as binary and ternary mixtures) using the concentration addition model. These pesticides were selected because they have a common mechanism of toxicity, are frequently detected in surface waters in Washington, and were recently evaluated in a biological opinion by the National Marine Fisheries Service.\nAll detected concentrations of chlorpyrifos and malathion, assessed as individual chemicals, exceeded the predicted no effect concentration, indicating potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. Further, risk quotients for all binary and ternary mixtures were greater than one, also indicative of potential for adverse effects on aquatic life. In all samples containing a mixture, the maximum cumulative ratio suggested that a single insecticide contributed &gt;50% of the overall toxicity of each mixture.

Outside of work, I love cooking and Ice skating 🛼.\n\n\n\n\n\nOther Research Interests\n\n\n\n\nComputer Vision\n\n\nVisual perception, object detection, semantic segmentation, and sensor fusion for autonomous systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical ML\n\n\nUncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, and data-driven inference in dynamic environments.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Driving Systems\n\n\nLearning-based control, trajectory planning, vision-based perception, and sensor fusion in autonomous driving environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore My Work\n\n\nBlogs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Scientist Interview Guide\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\nTalks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy Dummy Talk\n\n\nLearning How to Show a Card\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\nPublications\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\nProjects\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDRL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items\n\n\nSee all →\n\n\n\n\nNews Highlights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Jul 2025]\n\n\nSelected for the Cohere Machine Learning Summer School, hosted by Cohere Labs.\n\n\n\n\n[Mar 2025]\n\n\nOur paper on Advanced Semi-Supervised Learning with Uncertainty Estimation for Phase Identification in Distribution Systems has been accepted to IEEE PES General Meeting 2025.\n\n\n\n\n[Jan 2025]\n\n\nOur paper on Transfer Learning Enhanced Deep Reinforcement Learning for Volt-Var Control in Smart Grids has been accepted to IEEE PES Grid Edge Technologies Conference & Exposition 2025."

    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

    "text": "It has been two years since Quarto became the most popular reproducible publication tool in data science and R community. However Quarto is so much more than just a publication tool! I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.\nIn this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on ‘how’ to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nPsychosocial factors and responses to injury modify the transition from acute to chronic pain. Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms) exacerbate and cooccur with chronic pain. Yet no study has prospectively considered the associations among these psychological processes and pain reports using experience sampling methods (ESMs) during the acute aftermath of injury. This study applied ESM via daily text messaging to monitor and detect relationships among psychosocial factors and postinjury pain across the first 14 days after emergency department (ED) discharge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 75 adults (59% male; mean ± SD age = 34 ± 11.73 years) who experienced a potentially traumatic injury (i.e., involving life threat or serious injury) in the past 24 hours from the EDs of two Level I trauma centers. Participants received five questions per day via text messaging from Day 1 to Day 14 post–ED discharge; three questions measured PTSD symptoms, one question measured perceived social support, and one question measured physical pain.\n\n\nResults\nSixty-seven participants provided sufficient data for inclusion in the final analyses, and the average response rate per subject was 86%. Pain severity score decreased from a mean ± SD of 7.2 ± 2.0 to 4.4 ± 2.69 over 14 days and 50% of the variance in daily pain scores was within person. In multilevel structural equation models, pain scores decreased over time, and daily fluctuations of hyperarousal (B = 0.22, 95% confidetnce interval = 0.08–0.36) were uniquely associated with daily fluctuations in reported pain level within each person.\n\n\nConclusions\nDaily hyperarousal symptoms predict same-day pain severity over the acute postinjury recovery period. We also demonstrated feasibility to screen and identify patients at risk for pain chronicity in the acute aftermath of injury. Early interventions aimed at addressing hyperarousal (e.g., anxiolytics) could potentially aid in reducing experience of pain."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRelationships are among the most salient factors affecting happiness and wellbeing for individuals and families. Relationship science has identified the study of dyadic behavioral patterns between couple members during conflict as an important window in to relational functioning with both short-term and long-term consequences. Several methods have been developed for the momentary assessment of behavior during interpersonal transactions. Among these, the most popular is the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), which organizes social behavior into a set of discrete behavioral constructs. This study examines the interpersonal meaning of the SPAFF codes through the lens of interpersonal theory, which uses the fundamental dimensions of Dominance and Affiliation to organize interpersonal behavior. A sample of 67 couples completed a conflict task, which was video recorded and coded using SPAFF and a method for rating momentary interpersonal behavior, the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID). Actor partner interdependence models in a multilevel structural equation modeling framework were used to study the covariation of SPAFF codes and CAID ratings. Results showed that a number of SPAFF codes had clear interpersonal signatures, but many did not. Additionally, actor and partner effects for the same codes were strongly consistent with interpersonal theory’s principle of complementarity. Thus, findings reveal points of convergence and divergence in the 2 systems and provide support for central tenets of interpersonal theory. Future directions based on these initial findings are discussed."

    "text": "Abstract\nDimensional conceptualizations of psychopathology hold promise for understanding the high rates of comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Linking PTSD symptoms to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology may enable researchers and clinicians to understand the patterns and breadth of behavioral sequelae following traumatic experiences that may be shared with other psychiatric disorders. To explore this premise, we recruited a trauma-exposed online community sample \\((N = 462)\\) and measured dimensional transdiagnostic traits of psychopathology using parceled facets derived from the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Faceted–Short Form. PTSD symptom factors were measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and derived using confirmatory factor analysis according to the seven-factor hybrid model (i.e., Intrusions, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, Anxious Arousal, And Dysphoric Arousal). We observed hypothesized associations between PTSD factors and transdiagnostic traits indicating that some transdiagnostic dimensions were associated with nearly all PTSD symptom factors (e.g., emotional lability: rmean = .35), whereas others showed more unique relationships (e.g., hostility–Externalizing Behavior: \\(r = .60\\); hostility with other PTSD factors: \\(r = .12–.31\\)). All PTSD factors were correlated with traits beyond those that would appear to be construct-relevant, suggesting the possibility of indirect associations that should be explicated in future research. The results indicate the breadth of trait-like consequences associated with PTSD symptom exacerbation, with implications for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Although PTSD is not a personality disorder, the findings indicate that increased PTSD factor severity is moderately associated with different patterns of trait-like disruptions in many areas of functioning."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe examined the relationship between psychopathology and interpersonal problems in a sample of 825 clinical and community participants. Sixteen psychiatric diagnoses and five transdiagnostic dimensions were examined in relation to self-reported interpersonal problems. The structural summary method was used with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems Circumplex Scales to examine interpersonal problem profiles for each diagnosis and dimension. We built a structural model of mental disorders including factors corresponding to detachment (avoidant personality, social phobia, major depression), internalizing (dependent personality, borderline personality, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress, major depression), disinhibition (antisocial personality, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, borderline personality), dominance (histrionic personality, narcissistic personality, paranoid personality), and compulsivity (obsessive-compulsive personality). All dimensions showed good interpersonal prototypicality (e.g., detachment was defined by a socially avoidant/nonassertive interpersonal profile) except for internalizing, which was diffusely associated with elevated interpersonal distress. The findings for individual disorders were largely consistent with the dimension that each disorder loaded on, with the exception of the internalizing and dominance disorders, which were interpersonally heterogeneous. These results replicate previous findings and provide novel insights into social dysfunction in psychopathology by wedding the power of hierarchical (i.e., dimensional) modeling and interpersonal circumplex assessment."

    "text": "Abstract\nPhysical attractiveness plays a central role in psychosocial experiences. One of the top research priorities has been to identify factors affecting perceptions of physical attractiveness (PPA). Recent work suggests PPA derives from different sources (e.g., target, perceiver, stimulus type). Although smiles in particular are believed to enhance PPA, support has been surprisingly limited. This study comprehensively examines the effect of smiles on PPA and, more broadly, evaluates the roles of target, perceiver, and stimulus type in PPA variation. Perceivers (n=181) rated both static images and 5-s videos of targets displaying smiling and neutral-expressions. Smiling images were rated as more attractive than neutral-expression images (regardless of stimulus motion format). Interestingly, perceptions of physical attractiveness were based more on the perceiver than on either the target or format in which the target was presented. Results clarify the effect of smiles, and highlight the significant role of the perceiver, in PPA."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nVan Oest (2019) developed a framework to assess interrater agreement for nominal categories and complete data. We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chance-corrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S-coefficient, Scott’s pi, Fleiss’ kappa, and Van Oest’s uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott’s pi and Fleiss’ kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient often performs much better than the S-coefficient, but the S-coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement."

    "section": "Translational Abstract",
    "text": "Translational Abstract\nMany studies and assessments require classification of subjective items (e.g., text) into categories (e.g., based on content). To assess whether the results are reproducible, it is good practice to let two or more raters independently classify the items, compute the proportion of pairwise rater agreement, and adjust for agreement expected by chance. Most chance-corrected agreement coefficients assume nominal categories and include only full agreements in which raters choose the same category. However, many situations (e.g., point scales) imply ordinal categories, where raters may receive partial credit for disagreements, based on the distance of their chosen categories and captured by a weighting scheme. Furthermore, raters often classify only subsets of items, where the missing data occur either by accident or by design. The present study develops a framework to estimate chance-corrected agreement for all four combinations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The resulting coefficient requires only a few lines of programming code and captures several existing coefficients via different values of its input parameters; it augments all nested coefficients with a weighting scheme and the option of missing item classifications. We use simulation to compare the coefficient performances for different weighting schemes, missing data mechanisms, and category proportions: The so-called uniform prior coefficient often (but not always) performs best. Furthermore, our framework implies that chance-corrected agreement coefficients, both unweighted and weighted, estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing."

We present the first large-scale evidence of cultural differences in observed facial behavior, including 740,984 participants from 12 countries around the world. We used an Internet-based framework to collect video data of participants in two different settings: in their homes and in market research facilities. Using computer vision algorithms designed for this dataset, we measured smiling and brow furrowing expressions as participants watched television ads. Our results reveal novel findings and provide empirical evidence to support theories about cultural and gender differences in display rules. Participants from more individualist cultures displayed more brow furrowing overall, whereas smiling depended on both culture and setting. Specifically, participants from more individualist countries were more expressive in the facility setting, while participants from more collectivist countries were more expressive in the home setting. Female participants displayed more smiling and less brow furrowing than male participants overall, with the latter difference being more pronounced in more individualist countries. This is the first study to leverage advances in computer science to enable large-scale observational research that would not have been possible using traditional methods."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID) is a method in which trained observers code individuals’ dominance and warmth continuously while they interact in dyads. This method has significant promise for assessing dynamic interpersonal processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of individual sex, dyadic familiarity, and situational conflict on patterns of interpersonal warmth, dominance, and complementarity as assessed via CAID. We used six samples with 603 dyads, including 2 samples of unacquainted mixed-sex undergraduates interacting in a collaborative task, 2 samples of couples interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks, and 2 samples of mothers and children interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks. Complementarity effects were robust across all samples, and individuals tended to be relatively warm and dominant. Results from multilevel models indicated that women were slightly warmer than men whereas there were no sex differences in dominance. Unfamiliar dyads and dyads interacting in more collaborative tasks were relatively warmer, more submissive, and more complementary on warmth but less complementary on dominance. These findings speak to the utility of the CAID method for assessing interpersonal dynamics and provide norms for researchers who use the method for different types of samples and applications."

Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical “clinical rounds” encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe quantified aspects of participants’ verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants’ PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures.\n\n\nResults\nOur predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis."

This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, utilizing clinical ratings collected from patients with either affective or non-affective psychoses (n = 1042). Drawing from established clinical instruments, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, a broad spectrum of core psychotic symptoms was considered for the model development. Among the candidate models considered, including correlated factors and multifactor models, a model with seven correlated factors encompassing positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, mania, disorganization, hostility, and anxiety was most interpretable with acceptable fit. The seven factors exhibited expected associations with external validators, were replicable through cross- validation, and were generalizable across affective and non-affective psychoses."

Research is needed to understand mechanisms of change during imaginal exposure for EDs, including whether within- and between-session distress reduction is related to treatment outcomes.\nMethod: Study 1 tested four sessions of online imaginal exposure (N = 143). Study 2 examined combined imaginal and in vivo exposure, comprising six imaginal exposure sessions (N = 26). ED symptoms and fears were assessed pre- and posttreatment, and subjective distress and state anxiety were collected during sessions.\nResults: Subjective distress tended to increase within-session in both studies, and within-session reduction was not associated with change in ED symptoms or fears. In Study 1, between-session reduction of distress and state anxiety was associated with greater decreases in ED symptoms and fears pre-to posttreatment. In Study 2, between-session distress reduction occurred but was not related to outcomes.\nConclusions: Within-session distress reduction may not promote change during exposure for EDs, whereas between-session distress reduction may be associated with better treatment outcomes. These findings corroborate research on distress reduction during exposure for anxiety disorders. Clinicians might consider approaches to exposure-based treatment that focus on distress tolerance and promote between-session distress reduction."

Data were acquired from a variety of sensors of the face that included high-resolution 3D dynamic imaging, high-resolution 2D video, and thermal (infrared) sensing, and contact physiological sensors that included electrical conductivity of the skin, respiration, blood pressure, and heart rate. Facial expression was annotated for both the occurrence and intensity of facial action units from 2D video by experts in the Facial Action Coding System (FACS).

    "text": "Abstract\nEmotional expressiveness captures the extent to which a person tends to outwardly display their emotions through behavior. Due to the close relationship between emotional expressiveness and behavioral health, as well as the crucial role that it plays in social interaction, the ability to automatically predict emotional expressiveness stands to spur advances in science, medicine, and industry. In this paper, we explore three related research questions. First, how well can emotional expressiveness be predicted from visual,linguistic, and multimodal behavioral signals? Second, how important is each behavioral modality to the prediction of emotional expressiveness? Third, which behavioral signals are reliably related to emotional expressiveness? To answer these questions, we add highly reliable transcripts and human ratings of perceived emotional expressiveness to an existing video database and use this data to train, validate, and test predictive models. Our best model shows promising predictive performance on this dataset (RMSE=0.65,R2=0.45,r=0.74). Multimodal models tend to perform best overall, and models trained on the linguistic modality tend to outperform models trained on the visual modality. Finally,examination of our interpretable models’ coefficients reveals a number of visual and linguistic behavioral signals—such as facial action unit intensity, overall word count, and use of words related to social processes—that reliably predict emotional expressiveness."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe field of Automatic Facial Expression Analysis has grown rapidly in recent years. However, despite progress in new approaches as well as benchmarking efforts, most evaluations still focus on either posed expressions, near-frontal recordings, or both. This makes it hard to tell how existing expression recognition approaches perform under conditions where faces appear in a wide range of poses (or camera views), displaying ecologically valid expressions. The main obstacle for assessing this is the availability of suitable data, and the challenge proposed here addresses this limitation. The FG 2017 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017) extends FERA 2015 to the estimation of Action Units occurrence and intensity under different camera views. In this paper we present the third challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2017, in Washington, United States. Two sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, and the estimation of AU intensity. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for both sub-challenges."

One of the challenges that is actively being addressed is the automatic estimation of expression intensities. To continue to provide a standardisation platform and to help the field progress beyond its current limitations, the FG 2015 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2015) will challenge participants to estimate FACS Action Unit (AU) intensity as well as AU occurrence on a common benchmark dataset with reliable manual annotations. Evaluation will be done using a clear and well-defined protocol. In this paper we present the second such challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 11 IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2015, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Three sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, the estimation of AU intensity for pre-segmented data, and fully automatic AU intensity estimation. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for the three sub-challenges."

    "text": "Abstract\nImplementing a computerized facial expression analysis system for automatic coding requires that a threshold for the system’s classifier outputs be selected. However, there are many potential ways to select a threshold. How do different criteria and metrics compare? Manually FACS coded video of 45 clinical interviews (Spectrum dataset) were processed using person-specific active appearance models (AAM). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained using an independent dataset (RU-FACS). Spectrum sessions were randomly assigned to training (n=32) and testing sets (n=13). Six different threshold selection criteria were compared for automatic AU coding. Three major findings emerged: 1) Thresholds that attempt to balance the confusion matrix (using kappa, \\(F_1\\), or MCC) performed significantly better on all metrics than thresholds that select arbitrary error or accuracy rates (such as TPR, FPR, or EER). 2) AU detection scores for kappa, \\(F_1\\), and MCC were highly intercorrelated; accuracy was uncorrelated with the others. And 3) Kappa, MCC, and \\(F_1\\) were all positively correlated with base rate. They increased with increases in AU base rates. Accuracy, by contrast, showed the opposite pattern. It was strongly negatively correlated with base rate. These findings suggest that better automatic coding can be obtained by using threshold-selection criteria that balance the confusion matrix and benefit from increased AU base rates in the training data."

Digital video and expert coding of spontaneous facial activity from 80 subjects (over 350,000 frames) were used to train and test support vector machine classifiers. Appearance features were shape-normalized SIFT descriptors and shape features were 66 facial landmarks. Ten-fold cross-validation was used in all evaluations. Number of subjects and number of frames per subject differentially affected appearance and shape-based classifiers. For appearance features, which are high-dimensional, increasing the number of training subjects from 8 to 64 incrementally improved performance, regardless of the number of frames taken from each subject (ranging from 450 through 3600). In contrast, for shape features, increases in the number of training subjects and frames were associated with mixed results. In summary, maximal performance was attained using appearance features from large numbers of subjects with as few as 450 frames per subject. These findings suggest that variation in the number of subjects rather than number of frames per subject yields most efficient performance."

In contrast to previous work in Affective Computing, which pursued a single “ground truth” label for the affective content of each moment of each video (e.g., by averaging the ratings of 2 to 7 trained participants), we embrace the subjectivity inherent to emotional experiences and provide the full distribution of all participants’ ratings (with an average of 76.7 raters per video). We argue that this choice represents a paradigm shift with the potential to unlock new research directions, generate new hypotheses, and inspire novel methods in the Affective Computing community. We also describe several interdisciplinary use cases for the database: to provide dynamic norms for emotion elicitation studies (e.g., in psychology, medicine, and neuroscience), to train and test affective content analysis algorithms (e.g., for dynamic emotion recognition, video summarization, and movie recommendation), and to study subjectivity in emotional reactions (e.g., to identify moments of emotional ambiguity or ambivalence within movies, identify predictors of subjectivity, and develop personalized affective content analysis algorithms).

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe Duchenne smile hypothesis is that smiles that include eye constriction (AU6) are the product of genuine positive emotion, whereas smiles that do not are either falsified or related to negative emotion. This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion."

Depressed participants were followed over the course of treatment and video recorded during a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions were analyzed from the video using both manual and automatic systems. Automatic and manual coding were highly consistent for FACS action units, and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. For both systems, when symptom severity was high, participants made more facial expressions associated with contempt, smiled less, and those smiles that occurred were more likely to be accompanied by facial actions associated with contempt. These results are consistent with the “social risk hypothesis” of depression. According to this hypothesis, when symptoms are severe, depressed participants withdraw from other people in order to protect themselves from anticipated rejection, scorn, and social exclusion. As their symptoms fade, participants send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and produced the same pattern of depression effects suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready for use in behavioral and clinical science."

    "text": "Abstract\nMost work in automatic facial expression analysis seeks to detect discrete facial actions. Yet, the meaning and function of facial actions often depends in part on their intensity. We propose a part-based, sparse representation for automated measurement of continuous variation in AU intensity. We evaluated its effectiveness in two publically available databases, CK+ and the soon to be released Binghamton high-resolution spontaneous 3D dyadic facial expression database. The former consists of posed facial expressions and ordinal level intensity (absent, low, and high). The latter consists of spontaneous facial expression in response to diverse, well-validated emotion inductions, and 6 ordinal levels of AU intensity. In a preliminary test, we started from discrete emotion labels and ordinal-scale intensity annotation in the CK+ dataset. The algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. These preliminary results supported the utility of the part-based, sparse representation. Second, we applied the algorithm to the more demanding task of continuous AU intensity estimation in spontaneous facial behavior in the Binghamton database. Manual 6-point ordinal coding and continuous measurement were highly consistent. Visual analysis of the overlay of continuous measurement by the algorithm and manual ordinal coding strongly supported the representational power of the proposed method to smoothly interpolate across the full range of AU intensity."

The subjective evaluation of artificial human-like behaviour in embodied conversational agents is however expensive and little is known about the quality of the data it returns. Two approaches to subjective evaluation can be largely distinguished, one relying on ratings, the other on pairwise comparisons. In this study we use co-speech gestures to compare the two against each other and answer questions about their appropriateness for evaluation of artificial behaviour. We consider their ability to rate quality, but also aspects pertaining to the effort of use and the time required to collect subjective data.We use crowd sourcing to rate the quality of co-speech gestures in avatars, assessing which method picks up more detail in subjective assessments. We compared gestures generated by three different machine learning models with various level of behavioural quality. We found that both approaches were able to rank the videos according to quality and that the ranking significantly correlated, showing that in terms of quality there is no preference of one method over the other. We also found that pairwise comparisons were slightly faster and came with improved inter-rater reliability, suggesting that for small-scale studies pairwise comparisons are to be favoured over ratings."

    "text": "Abstract\nIn recent years, extensive research has emerged in affective computing on topics like automatic emotion recognition and determining the signals that characterize individual emotions. Much less studied, however, is expressiveness—the extent to which someone shows any feeling or emotion. Expressiveness is related to personality and mental health and plays a crucial role in social interaction. As such, the ability to automatically detect or predict expressiveness can facilitate significant advancements in areas ranging from psychiatric care to artificial social intelligence. Motivated by these potential applications, we present an extension of the BP4D+ dataset with human ratings of expressiveness and develop methods for (1) automatically predicting expressiveness from visual data and (2) defining relationships between interpretable visual signals and expressiveness. In addition, we study the emotional context in which expressiveness occurs and hypothesize that different sets of signals are indicative of expressiveness in different con-texts (e.g., in response to surprise or in response to pain). Analysis of our statistical models confirms our hypothesis. Consequently, by looking at expressiveness separately in distinct emotional contexts, our predictive models show significant improvements over baselines and achieve com-parable results to human performance in terms of correlation with the ground truth."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe affective computing community has invested heavily in building automated tools for the analysis of facial behavior and the expression of emotion. These tools present a valuable, but largely untapped, opportunity for social scientists to perform observational analyses of nonverbal behavior at very large scale. Various tech companies are collecting huge corpora of images and videos from around the world that could be used to study important scientific questions. However, privacy restrictions and intellectual property concerns render these data inaccessible to most academics. Unfortunately, this limits the potential for scientific advancement and leads to the consolidation of data and opportunity into the hands of a few powerful institutions. In this paper, we ask whether similar psychological insights can be gained by analyzing smaller, public datasets that are more within reach for academic researchers. As a proof-of-concept for this idea, we gather, analyze, and release a corpus of public images and metadata and use it to replicate recent psychological findings about smiling, gender, and culture. In so doing, we provide evidence that psychological insights can indeed by democratized through the automated analysis of nonverbal behavior."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between a therapist and their client is one of the most critical determinants of successful therapy. The working alliance is a multifaceted concept capturing the collaborative aspect of the therapist-client relationship; a strong working alliance has been extensively linked to many positive therapeutic outcomes. Although therapy sessions are decidedly multimodal interactions, the language modality is of particular interest given its recognized relationship to similar dyadic concepts such as rapport, cooperation, and affiliation. Specifically, in this work we study language entrainment, which measures how much the therapist and client adapt toward each other’s use of language over time. Despite the growing body of work in this area, however, relatively few studies examine causal relationships between human behavior and these relationship metrics: does an individual’s perception of their partner affect how they speak, or does how they speak affect their perception? We explore these questions in this work through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, which allow for both multilevel and temporal modeling of the relationship between the quality of the therapist-client working alliance and the participants’ language entrainment. In our first experiment, we demonstrate that these techniques perform well in comparison to other common machine learning models, with the added benefits of interpretability and causal analysis. In our second analysis, we interpret the learned models to examine the relationship between working alliance and language entrainment and address our exploratory research questions. The results reveal that a therapist’s language entrainment can have a significant impact on the client’s perception of the working alliance, and that the client’s language entrainment is a strong indicator of their perception of the working alliance. We discuss the implications of these results and consider several directions for future work in multimodality."

    "text": "Abstract\nFacial behavior is a valuable source of information about an individual’s feelings and intentions. However, many factors combine to influence and moderate facial behavior including personality, gender, context, and culture. Due to the high cost of traditional observational methods, the relationship between culture and facial behavior is not well-understood. In the current study, we explored the sociocultural factors that influence facial behavior using large-scale observational analyses. We developed and implemented an algorithm to automatically analyze the smiling of 866,726 participants across 31 different countries. We found that participants smiled more when from a country that is higher in individualism, has a lower population density, and has a long history of immigration diversity (i.e., historical heterogeneity). Our findings provide the first evidence that historical heterogeneity predicts actual smiling behavior. Furthermore, they converge with previous findings using selfreport methods. Taken together, these findings support the theory that historical heterogeneity explains, and may even contribute to the development of, permissive cultural display rules that encourage the open expression of emotion."

    "text": "Abstract\nMethods to assess individual facial actions have potential to shed light on important behavioral phenomena ranging from emotion and social interaction to psychological disorders and health. However, manual coding of such actions is labor intensive and requires extensive training. To date, establishing reliable automated coding of unscripted facial actions has been a daunting challenge impeding development of psychological theories and applications requiring facial expression assessment. It is therefore essential that automated coding systems be developed with enough precision and robustness to ease the burden of manual coding in challenging data involving variation in participant gender, ethnicity, head pose, speech, and occlusion. We report a major advance in automated coding of spontaneous facial actions during an unscripted social interaction involving three strangers. For each participant (n = 80, 47 % women, 15 % Nonwhite), 25 facial action units (AUs) were manually coded from video using the Facial Action Coding System. Twelve AUs occurred more than 3 % of the time and were processed using automated FACS coding. Automated coding showed very strong reliability for the proportion of time that each AU occurred (mean intraclass correlation = 0.89), and the more stringent criterion of frame-by-frame reliability was moderate to strong (mean Matthew’s correlation = 0.61). With few exceptions, differences in AU detection related to gender, ethnicity, pose, and average pixel intensity were small. Fewer than 6 % of frames could be coded manually but not automatically. These findings suggest automated FACS coding has progressed sufficiently to be applied to observational research in emotion and related areas of study."

    "text": "Abstract\nBoth the occurrence and intensity of facial expressions are critical to what the face reveals. While much progress has been made towards the automatic detection of facial expression occurrence, controversy exists about how to estimate expression intensity. The most straight-forward approach is to train multiclass or regression models using intensity ground truth. However, collecting intensity ground truth is even more time consuming and expensive than collecting binary ground truth. As a shortcut, some researchers have proposed using the decision values of binary-trained maximum margin classifiers as a proxy for expression intensity. We provide empirical evidence that this heuristic is flawed in practice as well as in theory. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts when it comes to estimating smile intensity: researchers must take the time to collect and train on intensity ground truth. However, if they do so, high reliability with expert human coders can be achieved. Intensity-trained multiclass and regression models outperformed binary-trained classifier decision values on smile intensity estimation across multiple databases and methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Multiclass models even outperformed binary–trained classifiers on smile occurrence detection."

    "text": "Abstract\nFacial expression is central to human experience. Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka “spontaneous”) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between nonverbal behavior and severity of depression was investigated by following depressed participants over the course of treatment and video recording a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for FACS action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Emotion measurement is central to capturing acute alcohol reinforcement and so to informing models of alcohol use disorder etiology. Yet our understanding of how alcohol impacts emotion as assessed across diverse response modalities remains incomplete. The present study leverages a social alcohol-administration paradigm to assess drinking-related emotions, aiming to elucidate impacts of intoxication on self-reported versus behaviorally expressed emotion. Method: Participants (N = 60; Mage = 22.5; 50% male; 55% White) attended two counterbalanced laboratory sessions, on one of which they were administered an alcoholic beverage (target blood alcohol content .08%) and on the other a nonalcoholic control beverage. Participants in both conditions were accurately informed of beverage contents and consumed study beverages in assigned groups of three while their behavior was videotaped. Emotion was assessed via self-report as well as continuous coding of facial muscle movements. Results: The relationship between self-reported and behaviorally expressed emotion diverged significantly across beverage conditions: positive affect: b = −0.174, t = −2.36, p = .022; negative affect, b = 0.4319, t = 2.37, p = .021. Specifically, self-reports and behavioral displays converged among sober but not intoxicated participants. Further, alcohol’s effects on positive facial displays remained significant in models controlling for self-reported positive and negative emotion, with alcohol enhancing Duchenne smiles 20% beyond effects captured via self-reports, pointing to unique effects of alcohol on behavioral indicators of positive emotion. Conclusions: Findings highlight effects of acute intoxication on the convergence and divergence of emotion measures, thus informing our understanding of measures for capturing emotions that are most proximal to drinking and thus most immediately reinforcing of alcohol consumption."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Expert consensus guidelines recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), interventions that were historically delivered face-to-face, as first-line treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite the ubiquity of telehealth following the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about differential outcomes with CBT versus IPT delivered in-person (IP) or via telehealth (TH) or whether working alliance is affected.\nMethods: Adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for MDD were randomly assigned to either 8 sessions of IPT or CBT (group). Mid-trial, COVID-19 forced a change of therapy delivery from IP to TH (study phase). We compared changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) and Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) scores for individuals by group and phase: CBT-IP (n = 24), CBT-TH (n = 11), IPT-IP (n = 25) and IPT-TH (n = 17).\nResults: HRSD-17 scores declined significantly from pre to post treatment (pre: M = 17.7, SD = 4.4 vs. post: M = 11.7, SD = 5.9; p &lt; .001; d = 1.45) without significant group or phase effects. WAI scores did not differ by group or phase. Number of completed therapy sessions was greater for TH (M = 7.8, SD = 1.2) relative to IP (M = 7.2, SD = 1.6) (Mann-Whitney U = 387.50, z = 2.24, p = .025).\nLimitations: Participants were not randomly assigned to IP versus TH. Sample size is small.\nConclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy of both brief IPT and CBT, delivered by either TH or IP, for depression. It showed that working alliance is preserved in TH, and delivery via TH may improve therapy adherence. Prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively test efficacy of brief IPT and CBT delivered via TH versus IP."

Participants included 450 adolescents aged 12-14 years in the southern United States. Regression analyses showed favorable attitudes toward sexual behavior and social norms significantly predicted recent sexual behavior, and favorable attitudes toward condoms significantly predicted condom usage. Self-efficacy was not found to be predictive of adolescents’ sexual behavior or condom use. There were no significant differences in recent sexual behavior based on type of sexuality education. Adolescents who received abstinence-only education had reduced favorable attitudes toward condom use, and were more likely to have unprotected sex than the comparison group. Findings suggest that adolescents who receive abstinence-only education are at greater risk of engaging in unprotected sex."

In examining IPC correlates, we used a novel bootstrapping approach to determine if admiration and rivalry related to differing interpersonal profiles. Consistent with our hypotheses, admiration was distinctly related to generally agentic (i.e., dominant) interpersonal processes, whereas rivalry generally reflected (low) communal (i.e., hostile) interpersonal processes. Furthermore, NARQ-admiration and NARQ-rivalry related to generally adaptive and maladaptive aspects of status-related constructs, emotional, personality, and social adjustment, respectively. This research provides further support for the NARC, as well as construct validation for the NARQ."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe common view of emotional expressions is that certain configurations of facial-muscle movements reliably reveal certain categories of emotion. The principal exemplar of this view is the Duchenne smile, a configuration of facial-muscle movements (i.e., smiling with eye constriction) that has been argued to reliably reveal genuine positive emotion. In this paper, we formalized a list of hypotheses that have been proposed regarding the Duchenne smile, briefly reviewed the literature weighing on these hypotheses, identified limitations and unanswered questions, and conducted two empirical studies to begin addressing these limitations and answering these questions. Both studies analyzed a database of 751 smiles observed while 136 participants completed experimental tasks designed to elicit amusement, embarrassment, fear, and physical pain. Study 1 focused on participants’ self-reported positive emotion and Study 2 focused on how third-party observers would perceive videos of these smiles. Most of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the Duchenne smile were either contradicted by or only weakly supported by our data. Eye constriction did provide some information about experienced positive emotion, but this information was lacking in specificity, already provided by other smile characteristics, and highly dependent on context. Eye constriction provided more information about perceived positive emotion, including some unique information over other smile characteristics, but context was also important here as well. Overall, our results suggest that accurately inferring positive emotion from a smile requires more sophisticated methods than simply looking for the presence/absence (or even the intensity) of eye constriction."

    "text": "Abstract\nMen and women differ dramatically in their rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and researchers have long been interested in identifying mechanisms underlying male vulnerability to problem drinking. Surveys suggest that social processes underlie sex differences in drinking patterns, with men reporting greater social enhancement from alcohol than women, and all-male social drinking contexts being associated with particularly high rates of hazardous drinking. But experimental evidence for sex differences in social-emotional response to alcohol has heretofore been lacking. Research using larger sample sizes, a social context, and more sensitive measures of alcohol’s rewarding effects may be necessary to better understand sex differences in the etiology of AUD. This study explored the acute effects of alcohol during social exchange on speech volume –an objective measure of social-emotional experience that was reliably captured at the group level. Social drinkers (360 male; 360 female) consumed alcohol (.82g/kg males; .74g/kg females), placebo, or a no-alcohol control beverage in groups of three over 36-minutes. Within each of the three beverage conditions, equal numbers of groups consisted of all males, all females, 2 females and 1 male, and 1 female and 2 males. Speech volume was monitored continuously throughout the drink period, and group volume emerged as a robust correlate of self-report and facial indexes of social reward. Notably, alcohol-related increases in group volume were observed selectively in all-male groups but not in groups containing any females. Results point to social enhancement as a promising direction for research exploring factors underlying sex differences in problem drinking."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nYouth with bipolar disorder (BD) are at high risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and frequently experience interpersonal impairment, which is a risk factor for suicide. Yet, no study to date has examined the longitudinal associations between relationship quality in family/peer domains and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth with BD. Thus, we investigated how between-person differences – reflecting the average relationship quality across time – and within-person changes, reflecting recent fluctuations in relationship quality, act as distal and/or proximal risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used longitudinal data from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth Study (N = 413). Relationship quality variables were decomposed into stable (i.e., average) and varying (i.e., recent) components and entered, along with major clinical covariates, into separate Bayesian multilevel models predicting SI and suicide attempt. We also examined how the relationship quality effects interacted with age and sex.\n\n\nResults\nPoorer average relationship quality with parents (β = −.33, 95% Bayesian highest density interval (HDI) [−0.54, −0.11]) or friends (β = −.33, 95% HDI [−0.55, −0.11]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI but not suicide attempt. Worsening recent relationship quality with parents (β = −.10, 95% HDI [−0.19, −0.03]) and, to a lesser extent, friends (β = −.06, 95% HDI [−0.15, 0.03]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI, but only worsening recent relationship quality with parents was also associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (β = −.15, 95% HDI [−0.31, 0.01]). The effects of certain relationship quality variables were moderated by gender but not age.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong youth with BD, having poorer average relationship quality with peers and/or parents represents a distal risk factor for SI but not suicide attempts. Additionally, worsening recent relationship quality with parents may be a time-sensitive indicator of increased risk for SI or suicide attempt."

The current article provides an interdisciplinary primer on observational measurement; in particular, it highlights recent advances in observational methodology and the challenges that accompany such growth. First, we detail the various types of instrument that can be used to standardize measurements across observers. Second, we argue for the importance of validity in observational measurement and provide several approaches to validation based on contemporary validity theory. Third, we outline the challenges currently faced by observational researchers pertaining to measurement drift, observer reactivity, reliability analysis, and time/expense. Fourth, we describe recent advances in computer-assisted measurement, fully automated measurement, and statistical data analysis. Finally, we identify several key directions for future observational research to explore."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAs with many other racial and ethnic minorities, Hispanic Americans face substantial disparities in health care access and disease prevalence. The published literature on mental health disorders among Hispanic individuals, however, is not robust, and their experience of depressive disorders remains poorly understood. The construct of acculturation may help elucidate the risk of depression among Hispanic Americans and may inform the development of appropriate policy and treatment resources. We examined the degree to which acculturation may interact with key demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status [SES], and Mexican ancestry) in accounting for depressive symptomatology among Hispanic Americans. We conducted a series of Bayesian generalized linear mixed models using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to investigate the self-reported depressive symptomatology (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire−9) of Mexican Americans and other Hispanic individuals and to examine possible effects of acculturation and demographics on depressive symptomatology in this population. Mexican Americans had substantially lower levels of depression than other Hispanic individuals. Acculturation was positively associated with depression severity, but this effect was moderated by sex and SES. High acculturation was more strongly linked to depression among men and those of high SES. Acculturation and several demographic factors were associated with depressive symptomatology among Hispanic individuals. Acculturation can be useful in understanding risk, developing culturally informed interventions, and implementing community-level changes to address the burden of Hispanic depression."

Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public.

    "text": "About the topic\nSituational awareness is key to fast response during a public health emergency, such as COVID-19 pandemic. However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

    "text": "2024.7.8-11, Salzburg, Austria. Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

Sykdomspulsen processes new data collected from 15 data sources (e.g., covid-19 cases), runs 1000.000+ statistical analysis automatically for all locations (nation, county, municipality) in Norway, produces 1000+ reports and alerts for public health authorities and shares data to the public on GitHub.\nSykdomspulsen runs on a collection of R packages, the {splverse}. {splverse} is an ecosystem for infectious disease surveillance, from analysis planning, statistical analysis to reporting via visualization, shiny website and Rmarkdown generated reports. In this talk, Chi will present how Sykdomspulsen does public health real-time surveillance during the pandemic using R. Chi will introduce some of the core packages and illustrate how they work together, with an example using real surveillance data published daily on GitHub.\n\n\nAbout the speaker\nChi is currently working at the Sykdomspulsen team as a researcher and R developer, at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. Before she joined Sykdomspulsen in the middle of the pandemic (2020), she was a PhD student at the Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo (OCBE), working on hospital EHR data."

    "text": "It has been two years since Quarto became the most popular reproducible publication tool in data science and R community. However Quarto is so much more than just a publication tool! I started using it since late 2022, and it has helped me become more organized, productive and connected with people in the data science community.\nIn this talk I will not focus on the technical aspects on ‘how’ to use this tool. In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun! I hope this talk will provide you with some new ideas on how to use this fantastic technology to fulfill your goals."

    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

In the first part of the talk, I would like to report the latest news and trends seen in the useR conference and Posit conf, the two biggest global R events. In the second part, I will share my own experience in using Quarto for my career: from learning new skills, collaborating with co-workers, teaching university courses to networking and building a community (CAMIS collaboration). It is a powerful tool to share your work, and make new connections - both for work and for fun!

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are “close”, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‘sticky notes’ help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Emotion measurement is central to capturing acute alcohol reinforcement and so to informing models of alcohol use disorder etiology. Yet our understanding of how alcohol impacts emotion as assessed across diverse response modalities remains incomplete. The present study leverages a social alcohol-administration paradigm to assess drinking-related emotions, aiming to elucidate impacts of intoxication on self-reported versus behaviorally expressed emotion. Method: Participants (N = 60; Mage = 22.5; 50% male; 55% White) attended two counterbalanced laboratory sessions, on one of which they were administered an alcoholic beverage (target blood alcohol content .08%) and on the other a nonalcoholic control beverage. Participants in both conditions were accurately informed of beverage contents and consumed study beverages in assigned groups of three while their behavior was videotaped. Emotion was assessed via self-report as well as continuous coding of facial muscle movements. Results: The relationship between self-reported and behaviorally expressed emotion diverged significantly across beverage conditions: positive affect: b = −0.174, t = −2.36, p = .022; negative affect, b = 0.4319, t = 2.37, p = .021. Specifically, self-reports and behavioral displays converged among sober but not intoxicated participants. Further, alcohol’s effects on positive facial displays remained significant in models controlling for self-reported positive and negative emotion, with alcohol enhancing Duchenne smiles 20% beyond effects captured via self-reports, pointing to unique effects of alcohol on behavioral indicators of positive emotion. Conclusions: Findings highlight effects of acute intoxication on the convergence and divergence of emotion measures, thus informing our understanding of measures for capturing emotions that are most proximal to drinking and thus most immediately reinforcing of alcohol consumption."

One of the top research priorities has been to identify factors affecting perceptions of physical attractiveness (PPA). Recent work suggests PPA derives from different sources (e.g., target, perceiver, stimulus type). Although smiles in particular are believed to enhance PPA, support has been surprisingly limited. This study comprehensively examines the effect of smiles on PPA and, more broadly, evaluates the roles of target, perceiver, and stimulus type in PPA variation. Perceivers (n=181) rated both static images and 5-s videos of targets displaying smiling and neutral-expressions. Smiling images were rated as more attractive than neutral-expression images (regardless of stimulus motion format). Interestingly, perceptions of physical attractiveness were based more on the perceiver than on either the target or format in which the target was presented. Results clarify the effect of smiles, and highlight the significant role of the perceiver, in PPA."

    "text": "Abstract\nMen and women differ dramatically in their rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and researchers have long been interested in identifying mechanisms underlying male vulnerability to problem drinking. Surveys suggest that social processes underlie sex differences in drinking patterns, with men reporting greater social enhancement from alcohol than women, and all-male social drinking contexts being associated with particularly high rates of hazardous drinking. But experimental evidence for sex differences in social-emotional response to alcohol has heretofore been lacking. Research using larger sample sizes, a social context, and more sensitive measures of alcohol’s rewarding effects may be necessary to better understand sex differences in the etiology of AUD. This study explored the acute effects of alcohol during social exchange on speech volume –an objective measure of social-emotional experience that was reliably captured at the group level. Social drinkers (360 male; 360 female) consumed alcohol (.82g/kg males; .74g/kg females), placebo, or a no-alcohol control beverage in groups of three over 36-minutes. Within each of the three beverage conditions, equal numbers of groups consisted of all males, all females, 2 females and 1 male, and 1 female and 2 males. Speech volume was monitored continuously throughout the drink period, and group volume emerged as a robust correlate of self-report and facial indexes of social reward. Notably, alcohol-related increases in group volume were observed selectively in all-male groups but not in groups containing any females. Results point to social enhancement as a promising direction for research exploring factors underlying sex differences in problem drinking."

    "text": "Abstract\nObjective: Imaginal exposure is a novel intervention for eating disorders (EDs) that has been investigated as a method for targeting ED symptoms and fears. Research is needed to understand mechanisms of change during imaginal exposure for EDs, including whether within- and between-session distress reduction is related to treatment outcomes.\nMethod: Study 1 tested four sessions of online imaginal exposure (N = 143). Study 2 examined combined imaginal and in vivo exposure, comprising six imaginal exposure sessions (N = 26). ED symptoms and fears were assessed pre- and posttreatment, and subjective distress and state anxiety were collected during sessions.\nResults: Subjective distress tended to increase within-session in both studies, and within-session reduction was not associated with change in ED symptoms or fears. In Study 1, between-session reduction of distress and state anxiety was associated with greater decreases in ED symptoms and fears pre-to posttreatment. In Study 2, between-session distress reduction occurred but was not related to outcomes.\nConclusions: Within-session distress reduction may not promote change during exposure for EDs, whereas between-session distress reduction may be associated with better treatment outcomes. These findings corroborate research on distress reduction during exposure for anxiety disorders. Clinicians might consider approaches to exposure-based treatment that focus on distress tolerance and promote between-session distress reduction."

This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, utilizing clinical ratings collected from patients with either affective or non-affective psychoses (n = 1042). Drawing from established clinical instruments, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, a broad spectrum of core psychotic symptoms was considered for the model development. Among the candidate models considered, including correlated factors and multifactor models, a model with seven correlated factors encompassing positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, mania, disorganization, hostility, and anxiety was most interpretable with acceptable fit. The seven factors exhibited expected associations with external validators, were replicable through cross- validation, and were generalizable across affective and non-affective psychoses."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe high penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the grid introduces complexity to the operation and optimization of energy. One potential solution to the challenge is to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based techniques to regulate voltage and reactive power under dynamic conditions. However, there is a need to optimize the DRL for better performance and robustness. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization (BO) technique within the DRL framework to improve the performance and robustness of volt-var control (VVC) in power distribution systems. We combine the actor-critic DRL algorithm with the BO framework to yield fast optimal volt-var control policies. We use BO techniques to estimate DRL-based VVC decisions and accelerate model-training convergence. In the case study, we demonstrated that the BO in DRL on IEEE-13 has improved decision-making by 21.11% and 81.81% for 123 bus test systems. Our research shows that Bayesian-enabled DRL adapts to different grid configurations and maintains voltage profiles within desired limits, thereby improving DRL control policies."

This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, utilizing clinical ratings collected from patients with either affective or non-affective psychoses (n = 1042). Drawing from established clinical instruments, such as the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, Young Mania Rating Scale, and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, a broad spectrum of core psychotic symptoms was considered for the model development. Among the candidate models considered, including correlated factors and multifactor models, a model with seven correlated factors encompassing positive symptoms, negative symptoms, depression, mania, disorganization, hostility, and anxiety was most interpretable with acceptable fit. The seven factors exhibited expected associations with external validators, were replicable through cross- validation, and were generalizable across affective and non-affective psychoses."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe integration of renewable energy resources has made power system management increasingly complex. DRL is a potential solution to optimize power system operations, but it requires significant time and resources during training. The control policies developed using DRL are specific to a single grid and require retraining from scratch for other grids. Training the DRL model from scratch is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel TL with a DRL framework to optimize VV C across different grids. This framework significantly reduces training time and improves VVC control performance by fine-tuning pre-trained DRL models for various grids. We developed a policy reuse classifier that transfers the knowledge from the IEEE-123 Bus system to the IEEE-13 Bus system. We performed an impact analysis to determine the effectiveness of TL. Our results show that TL improves the VVC control policy by 69.51 %, achieves faster convergence, and reduces the training time by 98.14%."

    "text": "Abstract\nMen and women differ dramatically in their rates of alcohol use disorder (AUD), and researchers have long been interested in identifying mechanisms underlying male vulnerability to problem drinking. Surveys suggest that social processes underlie sex differences in drinking patterns, with men reporting greater social enhancement from alcohol than women, and all-male social drinking contexts being associated with particularly high rates of hazardous drinking. But experimental evidence for sex differences in social-emotional response to alcohol has heretofore been lacking. Research using larger sample sizes, a social context, and more sensitive measures of alcohol’s rewarding effects may be necessary to better understand sex differences in the etiology of AUD. This study explored the acute effects of alcohol during social exchange on speech volume –an objective measure of social-emotional experience that was reliably captured at the group level. Social drinkers (360 male; 360 female) consumed alcohol (.82g/kg males; .74g/kg females), placebo, or a no-alcohol control beverage in groups of three over 36-minutes. Within each of the three beverage conditions, equal numbers of groups consisted of all males, all females, 2 females and 1 male, and 1 female and 2 males. Speech volume was monitored continuously throughout the drink period, and group volume emerged as a robust correlate of self-report and facial indexes of social reward. Notably, alcohol-related increases in group volume were observed selectively in all-male groups but not in groups containing any females. Results point to social enhancement as a promising direction for research exploring factors underlying sex differences in problem drinking."

    "text": "Abstract\nIntegrating distributed energy resources (DERs) into a power system requires more advanced control mechanisms. One of the control strategies used for Volt-VAR control (VVC) is to manage voltage and reactive power. With the increase in the complexity of the power system, there is a need to develop an autonomous and robust control mechanism using deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to enhance grid performance and adjust voltage and reactive power settings. These adjustments minimize losses and enhance voltage stability in the grid. In this paper, we proposed a novel approach to develop a DRL-based VVC framework and mitigation techniques to protect against stealthy white-box attacks targeting the trained control policies of the DRL model. The mitigation technique on the trained DRL is proposed to control the voltage violations on the smart grid to enhance the stability of the grid and minimize voltage irregularities. Our proposed mitigation technique provided better control policies for DRL-based VVC, successfully mitigating 100 percent of voltage violations in the smart grid environment. The results show that the mitigation technique enhances the security and robustness of trained DRL VVC agents."

In this paper, we introduce an energy optimization framework that optimizes the timing of appliance use based on dynamic carbon intensity and electricity prices. We determine optimal operation schedules using a multi-objective optimization model with a Gurobi solver and machine learning. We combine Random Forest and XGBoost for demand prediction, incorporating their uncertainty estimates into the optimization constraints. The model optimizes ON/OFF appliance schedules while considering constraints like minimum operating times and power balance. It shifts usage to lower-cost and carbon-intensity periods, which helps to reduce energy consumption.\nKey contributions include ML-based demand predictions and mixed-integer programming (MIP) optimization that improves robustness to prediction errors while adjusting schedules based on time-of-use pricing and carbon intensity. Our smart scheduling and load shifting achieve a 35.8% reduction in costs, a 38.6% decrease in carbon emissions, and a 25.8% reduction in peak demand using a carbon-aware scheduling algorithm. This framework effectively shifts loads to low-cost, low-carbon times, offering significant economic and environmental benefits for residential energy management without compromising user comfort."

However, gathering the most informative data from human sensors without task overloading remains a critical technical challenge. In this context, Value of Information (VOI) is a crucial decision- theoretic metric for scheduling interaction with human sensors. We present a new Deep Learning based VOI estimation framework that can be used to schedule collaborative human-machine sensing with efficient online inference and minimal policy hand-tuning. Supervised learning is used to train deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract hierarchical features from ‘images’ of belief spaces obtained via data fusion. These features can be associated with soft data query choices to reliably compute VOI for human interaction. The CNN framework is described in detail, and a performance comparison to a feature- based POMDP scheduling policy is provided. The practical feasibility of our method is also demonstrated on a mobile robotic search problem with language-based semantic human sensor inputs."

    "text": "Abstract\nBackground: Expert consensus guidelines recommend Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT), interventions that were historically delivered face-to-face, as first-line treatments for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). Despite the ubiquity of telehealth following the COVID-19 pandemic, little is known about differential outcomes with CBT versus IPT delivered in-person (IP) or via telehealth (TH) or whether working alliance is affected.\nMethods: Adults meeting DSM-5 criteria for MDD were randomly assigned to either 8 sessions of IPT or CBT (group). Mid-trial, COVID-19 forced a change of therapy delivery from IP to TH (study phase). We compared changes in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD-17) and Working Alliance Inventory (WAI) scores for individuals by group and phase: CBT-IP (n = 24), CBT-TH (n = 11), IPT-IP (n = 25) and IPT-TH (n = 17).\nResults: HRSD-17 scores declined significantly from pre to post treatment (pre: M = 17.7, SD = 4.4 vs. post: M = 11.7, SD = 5.9; p &lt; .001; d = 1.45) without significant group or phase effects. WAI scores did not differ by group or phase. Number of completed therapy sessions was greater for TH (M = 7.8, SD = 1.2) relative to IP (M = 7.2, SD = 1.6) (Mann-Whitney U = 387.50, z = 2.24, p = .025).\nLimitations: Participants were not randomly assigned to IP versus TH. Sample size is small.\nConclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence supporting the efficacy of both brief IPT and CBT, delivered by either TH or IP, for depression. It showed that working alliance is preserved in TH, and delivery via TH may improve therapy adherence. Prospective, randomized controlled trials are needed to definitively test efficacy of brief IPT and CBT delivered via TH versus IP."

Participants included 450 adolescents aged 12-14 years in the southern United States. Regression analyses showed favorable attitudes toward sexual behavior and social norms significantly predicted recent sexual behavior, and favorable attitudes toward condoms significantly predicted condom usage. Self-efficacy was not found to be predictive of adolescents’ sexual behavior or condom use. There were no significant differences in recent sexual behavior based on type of sexuality education. Adolescents who received abstinence-only education had reduced favorable attitudes toward condom use, and were more likely to have unprotected sex than the comparison group. Findings suggest that adolescents who receive abstinence-only education are at greater risk of engaging in unprotected sex."

    "text": "Abstract\nRelationships are among the most salient factors affecting happiness and wellbeing for individuals and families. Relationship science has identified the study of dyadic behavioral patterns between couple members during conflict as an important window in to relational functioning with both short-term and long-term consequences. Several methods have been developed for the momentary assessment of behavior during interpersonal transactions. Among these, the most popular is the Specific Affect Coding System (SPAFF), which organizes social behavior into a set of discrete behavioral constructs. This study examines the interpersonal meaning of the SPAFF codes through the lens of interpersonal theory, which uses the fundamental dimensions of Dominance and Affiliation to organize interpersonal behavior. A sample of 67 couples completed a conflict task, which was video recorded and coded using SPAFF and a method for rating momentary interpersonal behavior, the Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID). Actor partner interdependence models in a multilevel structural equation modeling framework were used to study the covariation of SPAFF codes and CAID ratings. Results showed that a number of SPAFF codes had clear interpersonal signatures, but many did not. Additionally, actor and partner effects for the same codes were strongly consistent with interpersonal theory’s principle of complementarity. Thus, findings reveal points of convergence and divergence in the 2 systems and provide support for central tenets of interpersonal theory. Future directions based on these initial findings are discussed."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nObjectives\nPsychosocial factors and responses to injury modify the transition from acute to chronic pain. Specifically, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (reexperiencing, avoidance, and hyperarousal symptoms) exacerbate and cooccur with chronic pain. Yet no study has prospectively considered the associations among these psychological processes and pain reports using experience sampling methods (ESMs) during the acute aftermath of injury. This study applied ESM via daily text messaging to monitor and detect relationships among psychosocial factors and postinjury pain across the first 14 days after emergency department (ED) discharge.\n\n\nMethods\nWe recruited 75 adults (59% male; mean ± SD age = 34 ± 11.73 years) who experienced a potentially traumatic injury (i.e., involving life threat or serious injury) in the past 24 hours from the EDs of two Level I trauma centers. Participants received five questions per day via text messaging from Day 1 to Day 14 post–ED discharge; three questions measured PTSD symptoms, one question measured perceived social support, and one question measured physical pain.\n\n\nResults\nSixty-seven participants provided sufficient data for inclusion in the final analyses, and the average response rate per subject was 86%. Pain severity score decreased from a mean ± SD of 7.2 ± 2.0 to 4.4 ± 2.69 over 14 days and 50% of the variance in daily pain scores was within person. In multilevel structural equation models, pain scores decreased over time, and daily fluctuations of hyperarousal (B = 0.22, 95% confidetnce interval = 0.08–0.36) were uniquely associated with daily fluctuations in reported pain level within each person.\n\n\nConclusions\nDaily hyperarousal symptoms predict same-day pain severity over the acute postinjury recovery period. We also demonstrated feasibility to screen and identify patients at risk for pain chronicity in the acute aftermath of injury. Early interventions aimed at addressing hyperarousal (e.g., anxiolytics) could potentially aid in reducing experience of pain."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Continuous Assessment of Interpersonal Dynamics (CAID) is a method in which trained observers code individuals’ dominance and warmth continuously while they interact in dyads. This method has significant promise for assessing dynamic interpersonal processes. The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of individual sex, dyadic familiarity, and situational conflict on patterns of interpersonal warmth, dominance, and complementarity as assessed via CAID. We used six samples with 603 dyads, including 2 samples of unacquainted mixed-sex undergraduates interacting in a collaborative task, 2 samples of couples interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks, and 2 samples of mothers and children interacting in both collaborative and conflict tasks. Complementarity effects were robust across all samples, and individuals tended to be relatively warm and dominant. Results from multilevel models indicated that women were slightly warmer than men whereas there were no sex differences in dominance. Unfamiliar dyads and dyads interacting in more collaborative tasks were relatively warmer, more submissive, and more complementary on warmth but less complementary on dominance. These findings speak to the utility of the CAID method for assessing interpersonal dynamics and provide norms for researchers who use the method for different types of samples and applications."

Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical “clinical rounds” encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe quantified aspects of participants’ verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants’ PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures.\n\n\nResults\nOur predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis."

    "text": "Abstract\nBoth the occurrence and intensity of facial expressions are critical to what the face reveals. While much progress has been made towards the automatic detection of facial expression occurrence, controversy exists about how to estimate expression intensity. The most straight-forward approach is to train multiclass or regression models using intensity ground truth. However, collecting intensity ground truth is even more time consuming and expensive than collecting binary ground truth. As a shortcut, some researchers have proposed using the decision values of binary-trained maximum margin classifiers as a proxy for expression intensity. We provide empirical evidence that this heuristic is flawed in practice as well as in theory. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts when it comes to estimating smile intensity: researchers must take the time to collect and train on intensity ground truth. However, if they do so, high reliability with expert human coders can be achieved. Intensity-trained multiclass and regression models outperformed binary-trained classifier decision values on smile intensity estimation across multiple databases and methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Multiclass models even outperformed binary–trained classifiers on smile occurrence detection."

Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka “spontaneous”) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between nonverbal behavior and severity of depression was investigated by following depressed participants over the course of treatment and video recording a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for FACS action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science."

    "text": "Abstract\nCARMA is a media annotation program that collects continuous ratings while displaying audio and video files. It is designed to be highly user-friendly and easily customizable. Based on Gottman and Levenson’s affect rating dial, CARMA enables researchers and study participants to provide moment-by-moment ratings of multimedia files using a computer mouse or keyboard. The rating scale can be configured on a number of parameters including the labels for its upper and lower bounds, its numerical range, and its visual representation. Annotations can be displayed alongside the multimedia file and saved for easy import into statistical analysis software. CARMA provides a tool for researchers in affective computing, human-computer interaction, and the social sciences who need to capture the unfolding of subjective experience and observable behavior over time."

    "text": "Abstract\nMethods to assess individual facial actions have potential to shed light on important behavioral phenomena ranging from emotion and social interaction to psychological disorders and health. However, manual coding of such actions is labor intensive and requires extensive training. To date, establishing reliable automated coding of unscripted facial actions has been a daunting challenge impeding development of psychological theories and applications requiring facial expression assessment. It is therefore essential that automated coding systems be developed with enough precision and robustness to ease the burden of manual coding in challenging data involving variation in participant gender, ethnicity, head pose, speech, and occlusion. We report a major advance in automated coding of spontaneous facial actions during an unscripted social interaction involving three strangers. For each participant (n = 80, 47 % women, 15 % Nonwhite), 25 facial action units (AUs) were manually coded from video using the Facial Action Coding System. Twelve AUs occurred more than 3 % of the time and were processed using automated FACS coding. Automated coding showed very strong reliability for the proportion of time that each AU occurred (mean intraclass correlation = 0.89), and the more stringent criterion of frame-by-frame reliability was moderate to strong (mean Matthew’s correlation = 0.61). With few exceptions, differences in AU detection related to gender, ethnicity, pose, and average pixel intensity were small. Fewer than 6 % of frames could be coded manually but not automatically. These findings suggest automated FACS coding has progressed sufficiently to be applied to observational research in emotion and related areas of study."

New computational approaches make possible automated audiovisual measurement of behaviors that humans struggle to quantify (e.g., movement velocity and voice inflection). These tools have the potential to improve screening and diagnosis, identify new behavioral indicators of depression, measure response to clinical intervention, and test clinical theories about underlying mechanisms. Highlights include a study that measured the temporal coordination of vocal tract and facial movements, a study that predicted which adolescents would go on to develop depression based on their voice qualities, and a study that tested the behavioral predictions of clinical theories using automated measures of facial actions and head motion."

    "text": "Abstract\nWe examined the relationship between psychopathology and interpersonal problems in a sample of 825 clinical and community participants. Sixteen psychiatric diagnoses and five transdiagnostic dimensions were examined in relation to self-reported interpersonal problems. The structural summary method was used with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems Circumplex Scales to examine interpersonal problem profiles for each diagnosis and dimension. We built a structural model of mental disorders including factors corresponding to detachment (avoidant personality, social phobia, major depression), internalizing (dependent personality, borderline personality, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress, major depression), disinhibition (antisocial personality, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, borderline personality), dominance (histrionic personality, narcissistic personality, paranoid personality), and compulsivity (obsessive-compulsive personality). All dimensions showed good interpersonal prototypicality (e.g., detachment was defined by a socially avoidant/nonassertive interpersonal profile) except for internalizing, which was diffusely associated with elevated interpersonal distress. The findings for individual disorders were largely consistent with the dimension that each disorder loaded on, with the exception of the internalizing and dominance disorders, which were interpersonally heterogeneous. These results replicate previous findings and provide novel insights into social dysfunction in psychopathology by wedding the power of hierarchical (i.e., dimensional) modeling and interpersonal circumplex assessment."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe common view of emotional expressions is that certain configurations of facial-muscle movements reliably reveal certain categories of emotion. The principal exemplar of this view is the Duchenne smile, a configuration of facial-muscle movements (i.e., smiling with eye constriction) that has been argued to reliably reveal genuine positive emotion. In this paper, we formalized a list of hypotheses that have been proposed regarding the Duchenne smile, briefly reviewed the literature weighing on these hypotheses, identified limitations and unanswered questions, and conducted two empirical studies to begin addressing these limitations and answering these questions. Both studies analyzed a database of 751 smiles observed while 136 participants completed experimental tasks designed to elicit amusement, embarrassment, fear, and physical pain. Study 1 focused on participants’ self-reported positive emotion and Study 2 focused on how third-party observers would perceive videos of these smiles. Most of the hypotheses that have been proposed about the Duchenne smile were either contradicted by or only weakly supported by our data. Eye constriction did provide some information about experienced positive emotion, but this information was lacking in specificity, already provided by other smile characteristics, and highly dependent on context. Eye constriction provided more information about perceived positive emotion, including some unique information over other smile characteristics, but context was also important here as well. Overall, our results suggest that accurately inferring positive emotion from a smile requires more sophisticated methods than simply looking for the presence/absence (or even the intensity) of eye constriction."

Two undergraduate samples (Sample 1: N = 290; Sample 2: N = 188) completed self-report measures of interpersonal processes based in the interpersonal circumplex (IPC), as well as measures of related constructs. In examining IPC correlates, we used a novel bootstrapping approach to determine if admiration and rivalry related to differing interpersonal profiles. Consistent with our hypotheses, admiration was distinctly related to generally agentic (i.e., dominant) interpersonal processes, whereas rivalry generally reflected (low) communal (i.e., hostile) interpersonal processes. Furthermore, NARQ-admiration and NARQ-rivalry related to generally adaptive and maladaptive aspects of status-related constructs, emotional, personality, and social adjustment, respectively. This research provides further support for the NARC, as well as construct validation for the NARQ."

    "text": "Abstract\nSelf-report studies have found evidence that cultures differ in the display rules they have for facial expressions (i.e., for what is appropriate for different people at different times). However, observational studies of actual patterns of facial behavior have been rare and typically limited to the analysis of dozens of participants from two or three regions. We present the first large-scale evidence of cultural differences in observed facial behavior, including 740,984 participants from 12 countries around the world. We used an Internet-based framework to collect video data of participants in two different settings: in their homes and in market research facilities. Using computer vision algorithms designed for this dataset, we measured smiling and brow furrowing expressions as participants watched television ads. Our results reveal novel findings and provide empirical evidence to support theories about cultural and gender differences in display rules. Participants from more individualist cultures displayed more brow furrowing overall, whereas smiling depended on both culture and setting. Specifically, participants from more individualist countries were more expressive in the facility setting, while participants from more collectivist countries were more expressive in the home setting. Female participants displayed more smiling and less brow furrowing than male participants overall, with the latter difference being more pronounced in more individualist countries. This is the first study to leverage advances in computer science to enable large-scale observational research that would not have been possible using traditional methods."

    "text": "Abstract\nAs with many other racial and ethnic minorities, Hispanic Americans face substantial disparities in health care access and disease prevalence. The published literature on mental health disorders among Hispanic individuals, however, is not robust, and their experience of depressive disorders remains poorly understood. The construct of acculturation may help elucidate the risk of depression among Hispanic Americans and may inform the development of appropriate policy and treatment resources. We examined the degree to which acculturation may interact with key demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status [SES], and Mexican ancestry) in accounting for depressive symptomatology among Hispanic Americans. We conducted a series of Bayesian generalized linear mixed models using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to investigate the self-reported depressive symptomatology (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire−9) of Mexican Americans and other Hispanic individuals and to examine possible effects of acculturation and demographics on depressive symptomatology in this population. Mexican Americans had substantially lower levels of depression than other Hispanic individuals. Acculturation was positively associated with depression severity, but this effect was moderated by sex and SES. High acculturation was more strongly linked to depression among men and those of high SES. Acculturation and several demographic factors were associated with depressive symptomatology among Hispanic individuals. Acculturation can be useful in understanding risk, developing culturally informed interventions, and implementing community-level changes to address the burden of Hispanic depression."

Yet, no study to date has examined the longitudinal associations between relationship quality in family/peer domains and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth with BD. Thus, we investigated how between-person differences – reflecting the average relationship quality across time – and within-person changes, reflecting recent fluctuations in relationship quality, act as distal and/or proximal risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used longitudinal data from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth Study (N = 413). Relationship quality variables were decomposed into stable (i.e., average) and varying (i.e., recent) components and entered, along with major clinical covariates, into separate Bayesian multilevel models predicting SI and suicide attempt. We also examined how the relationship quality effects interacted with age and sex.\n\n\nResults\nPoorer average relationship quality with parents (β = −.33, 95% Bayesian highest density interval (HDI) [−0.54, −0.11]) or friends (β = −.33, 95% HDI [−0.55, −0.11]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI but not suicide attempt. Worsening recent relationship quality with parents (β = −.10, 95% HDI [−0.19, −0.03]) and, to a lesser extent, friends (β = −.06, 95% HDI [−0.15, 0.03]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI, but only worsening recent relationship quality with parents was also associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (β = −.15, 95% HDI [−0.31, 0.01]). The effects of certain relationship quality variables were moderated by gender but not age.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong youth with BD, having poorer average relationship quality with peers and/or parents represents a distal risk factor for SI but not suicide attempts. Additionally, worsening recent relationship quality with parents may be a time-sensitive indicator of increased risk for SI or suicide attempt."

    "text": "Abstract\nDimensional conceptualizations of psychopathology hold promise for understanding the high rates of comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Linking PTSD symptoms to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology may enable researchers and clinicians to understand the patterns and breadth of behavioral sequelae following traumatic experiences that may be shared with other psychiatric disorders. To explore this premise, we recruited a trauma-exposed online community sample \\((N = 462)\\) and measured dimensional transdiagnostic traits of psychopathology using parceled facets derived from the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Faceted–Short Form. PTSD symptom factors were measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and derived using confirmatory factor analysis according to the seven-factor hybrid model (i.e., Intrusions, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, Anxious Arousal, And Dysphoric Arousal). We observed hypothesized associations between PTSD factors and transdiagnostic traits indicating that some transdiagnostic dimensions were associated with nearly all PTSD symptom factors (e.g., emotional lability: rmean = .35), whereas others showed more unique relationships (e.g., hostility–Externalizing Behavior: \\(r = .60\\); hostility with other PTSD factors: \\(r = .12–.31\\)). All PTSD factors were correlated with traits beyond those that would appear to be construct-relevant, suggesting the possibility of indirect associations that should be explicated in future research. The results indicate the breadth of trait-like consequences associated with PTSD symptom exacerbation, with implications for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Although PTSD is not a personality disorder, the findings indicate that increased PTSD factor severity is moderately associated with different patterns of trait-like disruptions in many areas of functioning."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nVan Oest (2019) developed a framework to assess interrater agreement for nominal categories and complete data. We generalize this framework to all four situations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The mathematical solution yields a chance-corrected agreement coefficient that accommodates any weighting scheme for penalizing rater disagreements and any number of raters and categories. By incorporating Bayesian estimates of the category proportions, the generalized coefficient also captures situations in which raters classify only subsets of items; that is, incomplete data. Furthermore, this coefficient encompasses existing chance-corrected agreement coefficients: the S-coefficient, Scott’s pi, Fleiss’ kappa, and Van Oest’s uniform prior coefficient, all augmented with a weighting scheme and the option of incomplete data. We use simulation to compare these nested coefficients. The uniform prior coefficient tends to perform best, in particular, if one category has a much larger proportion than others. The gap with Scott’s pi and Fleiss’ kappa widens if the weighting scheme becomes more lenient to small disagreements and often if more item classifications are missing; missingness biases play a moderating role. The uniform prior coefficient often performs much better than the S-coefficient, but the S-coefficient sometimes performs best for small samples, missing data, and lenient weighting schemes. The generalized framework implies a new interpretation of chance-corrected weighted agreement coefficients: These coefficients estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing. Whereas Van Oest showed this interpretation for unweighted agreement, we generalize to weighted agreement."

    "title": "Weighting schemes and incomplete data: A generalized Bayesian framework for chance-corrected interrater agreement",
    "section": "Translational Abstract",
    "text": "Translational Abstract\nMany studies and assessments require classification of subjective items (e.g., text) into categories (e.g., based on content). To assess whether the results are reproducible, it is good practice to let two or more raters independently classify the items, compute the proportion of pairwise rater agreement, and adjust for agreement expected by chance. Most chance-corrected agreement coefficients assume nominal categories and include only full agreements in which raters choose the same category. However, many situations (e.g., point scales) imply ordinal categories, where raters may receive partial credit for disagreements, based on the distance of their chosen categories and captured by a weighting scheme. Furthermore, raters often classify only subsets of items, where the missing data occur either by accident or by design. The present study develops a framework to estimate chance-corrected agreement for all four combinations of nominal or ordinal categories and complete or incomplete data. The resulting coefficient requires only a few lines of programming code and captures several existing coefficients via different values of its input parameters; it augments all nested coefficients with a weighting scheme and the option of missing item classifications. We use simulation to compare the coefficient performances for different weighting schemes, missing data mechanisms, and category proportions: The so-called uniform prior coefficient often (but not always) performs best. Furthermore, our framework implies that chance-corrected agreement coefficients, both unweighted and weighted, estimate the probability that both raters in a pair assign an item to its correct category without guessing."

    "text": "Quarto as a teaching tool\n\nFrom personal to workshop website\nI switched from blogdown to Quarto in late 2022, right after my PhD. It was initially a cure for a severe burnout from a combination of work-related stressors, when I desperately needed something other than research. My mental state was like the famous painting by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experience of the switch was explained in the previously mentioned blog. Briefly, it was light like a feather. Since I was quite satisfied, I thought, why don’t I make a workshop website? So I did.\nThe result was quite good, I made the (as far as I knew) first quarto workshop website at University of Oslo for the Oslo Bioinformatics Workshop Week 2022. Feedback from students were positive, and the instructor team thought it hosts the material in a more organized way.\n\n\nSingle day workshop -&gt; two week course\nI was greatly encouraged by the experience, so when I got a 50% position at University of Oslo as biostatistics lecturer, I thought, why don’t we have the same thing for the course?\n\n\n\n\n\nOh well, the workload is crushing. There were a few key differences:\n\nR scripts and material were unavailable since the course was originally in STATA. Everything need to be done from scratch, for at least 12 lab sessions;\nThe students generally have little IT skills, which means more effort need to be done to guide them through the ‘get started’ part.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt took one month to create the first version of the website. More details about the experience can be read here.\n\n\nAdding WebR to the course\nOne year later, as technology advances, we added new content to some parts of the website. Most notably is the interactivity achieved through WebR. For example, I made this page on randomness and statistical distribution where students can interactively modify code chunks in a web browser."

    "text": "The IBS (International Biometric Society) conference of the Central European Network, CEN2023 has been a great opportunity to keep myself up to date with the latest development of biostatistics, both in academia and industry. Thanks to the great effort made by the organizing committee and almighty Google Meet/Zoom, I have been able to follow the talks without any issue, and have definitely learned a lot.\nGiven my background, I paid more attention on talks and workshops on\n\nStatistical software, R programming and simulation\nCausal inference\n\nThere were also two topics that drew my attention: one is on statistical education towards medial professionals, the other is on a Data Challenge using RCT data.\n\nStatistical software\n\nSoftware Engineering Working Group (SWE WG), MMRM\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDaniel Sabanes Bove (Roche). First year of the Software Engineering working group - working together across organizations\nGonzalo Duran-Pacheco (Roche). Comparing R libraries with SAS’s PROC MIXED for the analysis of longitudinal continuous endpoints using MMRM\n\n\n\n\nThe ASA Biopharmaceutical Section (BIOP) Software Engineering Working Group SWE WG was established in 2022. Currently they have 3 work streams:\n\nmmrm implements MMRM (mixed models with repeated measures)\nbrms.mmrm, the Bayesian version of MMRM\nHealth Technology Assessment with R\n\nAt a later talk, mmrm was compared with SAS’s PROC MIXED and R’s nlme, glmmTMB for analyses of longitudinal continuous endpoints. In terms of speed and convergence, mmrm is superior than others; while the estimate prodouced by mmrm is very close to PROC MIXED and glmmTMB.\nThis looks like a very interesting tool to try out! Vignette\n\n\nSimulation tools and RWD\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMichael Kammer (Medical University of Vienna). An overview of R software tools to support simulation studies: towards standardizing coding practices.\n\n\n\n\nKammer and colleagues did a review on R packages for simulation, and selected 14 top simulation packages, including simstudy, simdata, synthpop, bigsimr and others. The full list is made available here.\nA real-world dataset, NHANES was also introduced here. The data can be accessed with R package nhanesA.\n\n\n\nCausal Inference\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInformation\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkshop: Implementing the estimand framework in global drug development: Application of causal inference approaches (Mouna Akacha, Björn Bornkamp, Alex Ocampo, Jiawei Wei at Novartis)\nKeynote: Ruth Keogh (LSHTM). Causal inference with observational data: A survival guide\n\n\n\nThese two workshop / talk cover slightly different scenarios: one in RCT, one for observational data. It deserves a whole article or more to elaborate on this topic, so I’m only putting some resources here.\nCausal inference is definitely gaining traction in recent years in both academia and industry. Techniques such as g-computation, IPW and doubly robust estimation are starting to become mainstream. It is fascinating that these techniques themselves are not bound to a fixed model.\nResources:\n\nWorkshop repository Code\nBook: Causal Inference: What If by Hernán and Robins (2020)\nPrincipal stratum strategy, Bornkamp et al. (2021)\nTime-dependent covariates, Keogh et al. (2023)\nTarget Trial Emulation (TTE), Hernán and Robins (2016)\n\n\n\nCovariate adjustment and data challenge with RCT data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKelly Van Lancker (Ghent University). Improving Power in Randomized Trials by Leveraging Baseline Variables\nDominic Magirr (Novartis). Organizing a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\nCraig Wang (Novartis). Participating in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment in RCTs\n\nPanel discussion: Jonathan Bartlett (LSHTM)\n\n\n\n23 teams at Novartis participated in a Data Challenge on Covariate Adjustment. They were given a fixed outcome model, and 5 prior studies trial data, and their task was to create the design matrices that improve the precision compared to unadjusted data.\nIf I were to select talks based on the category titles, I would probably missed the whole session. However, it is surprisingly similar to using not trial, but real-world data (such as EHR) to make predictions. The conclusion were similar as well: using “supercovariates” created by ML isn’t gaining much compared to simple models such as ANCOVA. Possible reasons:\n\nsmall to moderate data size\nlinear relationship between covariates and outcome\ngood enough prognostic variables\n\nIt was also mentioned that the winning team did some trick to reduce the variance among the covariates. Would be interesting to read about it.\nSome resources:\n\nLancker et al. The use of covariate adjustment in randomized controlled trials: an overview Paper\nCovariate adjustment tutorial, link\n\n\n\nStatistical education\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalk information\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMaren Vens et al (University of Lübeck). Biostatistics/Biometrics for physicians – essential or unnecessary? How do practicing physicians and dentists evaluate biostatistics? A cross-sectional survey\n\n\n\n\nStatistical education to students / professionals who are not used to working with data has always been tricky. Students generally think statistics is difficult, and need help from a statistician. However there are only limited number of statisticians. The talk by Vens and colleagues confirms what practicing statisticians know, but can’t do much about: most (87%) physicians and dentists in the survey need a statistician to help with their work.\nHow to improve the statistical competency is an important and relevant topic for discussion, and might require systematic changes in how it is taught. Use of modern technology can help, yet it’s only helpful when students start to not fear, or not find math and technology boring."

It is not necessary to have a paid coursera membership to view the course, everyone could access it.\nIt is a 4 part course released one month ago (Jan/Feb 2023), and it seems that a follow-up will be released in the future.\nOverall I think it strikes a good balance between high-level introduction of the good practices, and examples with how they are implemented. Even though the course focuses on clinical reporting in the pharmaceutical industry, the practices are highly relevant in other sectors as well (e.g. public health, academia, other industries that use open-source software).\nSpecific statistical methods, packages are introduced only at a high-level; which means the course is not for learning how to use this or that packages; but good practice guidelines.\nIn my opinion,\n\nit would be useful if the learner has some experience with software development and/or statistics; otherwise learners might not know how to practice them.\nmost of the examples are related to R packages (understandable), so some experience with R package (use or develop) is useful.\nit could be a very good study material for university students in related subjects.\n\n\n\n\nModule 1 (notes): what the requirements are regarding clinical reporting, what should be done to meet the quality standards;\nModule 2 (notes): DevOps and Agile\nModule 3 (notes): version Control, git workflows, reproducible clinical reporting\nModule 4 (notes): code quality, robust and reusable code, R packages\nModule 5 (notes): risk management with open source software\n\n\n\n\nI have a few years of experience as an R developer and academic researcher in related fields, so not all concepts are new to me.

The climate change mitigation potential of different on-farm practices depends on many site-specific factors such as geography, climate, soil type, and management history.\nTo maximize the climate change mitigation potential of the SFF program, and to optimize the use of every dollar, a decision support tool is required. This presentation demonstrates how two existing spatial datasets (NRCS’ COMET-Planner and WSDA’s Agricultural Land Use) can be integrated into a decision support tool using ArcGIS Dashboards and Experience Builder. This tool, called the Washington Climate Smart Estimator (WaCSE), allows users to compare the climate benefits of different agricultural practices across different counties in Washington.\nBy utilizing the intuitive user interface of ArcGIS Dashboards, WaCSE enables swift, science-based estimates of climate benefits, while remaining accessible for audiences of varied technical backgrounds.\nSee the old app built with ArcGIS.\n\n\nSlides\n\n\nOops!

    "text": "Time to try Quarto\nNow that I’ve finally completed the more pressing tasks in October 2022, I can catch up to the cool kids on twitter: create a website with Quarto!\nThere were quite a lot of discussions about Quarto in the summer 2022. I wasn’t following the discussions closely, but I remember there were quite a few talks in the Rstudio conference this year. Then more and more people switched to Quarto on Twitter. Then people I know also switched to Quarto. What’s the fuzz about?\nMy experience with Quarto is focused on websites. I have not tried other forms of publishing. So far I have created:\n\na workshop website for my colleagues\na personal website (the one you are reading right now)\nan R package (qtwAcademic)that wraps three Quarto website templates for beginners\n\nHere are a few things I like about Quarto. Given that I’m not very experienced in front-end development, these comments are going to be about ease-of-use and design, rather than the technicalities.\n\nClean look for both personal and workshop/courses\nWhen I was using “academic” template in blogdown, I liked the structure of the site: projects, talks, blog, softwares and publications sections are clearly displayed at the top. What I didn’t like is that the default homepage was a very long single page; yet its customisation wasn’t the easist. Other templates were either too simple (for blog only), or more suitable for image display (photography projects). I wanted a website that keep the good structure of “academic”, which is quite suitable for academics (hence the name); while keeping each section independent.\nWith distill I could achieve the structure I wanted; but I didn’t enjoy it too much as a personal website (at least it wasn’t as flexible as Quarto). distill is still pretty decent for organisations or documentation site.\nWith Quarto, I can achieve the desired looks for not only a personal website (with or without blogs), but also a workshop, event or even course website. This is fantastic! The top, sidebar or hybrid navigation makes the site structure very clear, especially when there are lots of content. As an aspiring lecturer at university, this is really One Quarto Rules Them All.\n\n\nFlexible yet not overwhelming\nAs I mentioned above, hacking “academic” in blogdown was not that easy - simply because there were too many folders that you are not actually supposed to modify. It was confusing to know what to change in order to achieve the desired output, and multiple folders were having the same names, making it very challenging for beginners. Ironically, this is usually the first template beginners start with!\nThat’s why I immediately fell for Quarto: you only need 4 components to make a decent minimalistic website work:\n\n_quarto.yml to control the overall layout\nindex.qmd at the root folder to control the homepage\nabout.qmd for some basic information about the creator or the website\nproject.qmd for projects or any other content that the creator wants to display\n\nThe way that _quarto.yml clearly specifies the .qmd files really helps beginners to understand where things are. This has been extremely useful for me when I wanted to learn how people made their website by reading the source code - I could understand exactly where to find the information I needed. The clear structure greatly helps the creators themselves, and also those who want to learn.\n\n\nGreat community\nRstats people have a great community. I wouldn’t be able to make my site the way I wanted if people haven’t been sharing their works. I have learned a lot by reading the source code by Dr Emi Tanaka, Dr David Schoch, Bea Milz, Prof Mine Cetinnkaya-Rundel’s STA 210 - Regression Analysis course.\nI also made my own R package that wraps three templates to create Quarto websites that are frequently used by academics, qtwAcademic. In the following days I plan to write up more detailed explanations on how to use the package, along with some new features."

    "title": "Open source reporting with R: clinical, public health, RSE and embrace the change",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Two days ago (Jan 11 2023) I watched a presentation by data scientists at Roche about why they are making their clinical trials in 2023 open source with R. As someone who uses R for most of the time and has done similar works (not in pharma, but in public health surveillance and reporting: watch my talk, Code to find out what we do), I watched the presentation with great interest. Here are my notes, combined with some thoughts on open-source in the industry, public sector and academia.\n\nThree reasons for why I am writing this blog\n\nNote down some of the technology which points towards the future of the field\nRelate to my experience of open-source applied in public health, specifically public health reporting\nShare some thoughts in statistical education of applied students/researchers (e.g. medicine), and training Research Software Engineers\n\n\n\nMy experience with statistical software\nTo put my opinions in perspective,\n\nI do not have experience with SAS or pharma, so I do not have first-hand knowledge on the functionality, ease-of-use or the popularity of commercial softwares in the industry.\nI did my MSc and PhD in statistics/biostatistics/medical informatics and R had always been a default choice.\nI worked in public health for a few years, where Excel is possibly the most common tool, and STATA and R are scarcely used (statisticians, epidemiologists, bioinformaticians).\nIn the past few years, my university has made the switch from SPSS to STATA for intro statistics for medical students (while students at higher level, or doing advanced analyses might use R/python), and a test-run with R might be in motion.\n\n\n\n\nClinical Reporting\nIn drug development at pharmaceutical companies (and/or research institutes and hospitals), these data related tasks are very common:\n\nsummarise safety and efficacy data\nprovide accurate picture of trial outcomes\nmanage data collection across different sites\n\nCompleting these tasks in a correct, efficient and reproducible manner is crucial for patient safety. However, these tasks are also highly resource intensive: highly trained scientist, statisticians and technincians must be involved in the process. Historically, pharma use commercial software such as SAS.\n\nRegulation and exploration needs\nThere are requirements for clinical reporting: both regulartory and exploratory. From the regulatory side, there exist industry standards (CDISC) in the clinical research process, such as SDTM (Model for Tabulation of Study Data) and ADaM (Analysis Data Model). Statistical analyses, tables, listings and graphs (TLGs) also fall into this cateogory.\nFrom the exploratory side, clinical data are highly context dependent, and new formats of data such as imaging are more and more used in prediction modeling and drug development.\nIn addition, it is not hard to imagine that the technical competency of employees differ, especially in large organizations. Enabling people with less experience to analyse trial data in a reproducible manner is helpful for not only the learning and growth of employees, but also the productivity of organizations.\nThe existing commercial tools are not able to adapt to the rapid changes in the field.\n\n\nTransition into Open-Source\nIn this talk, Dr Kieran Martin at Roche introduced that they started using R as their core data science tool, aiming to move their codebase to having a core R. In the future, they plan to have something that is lanugage agnostic: meaning that python, Stan, C++, Julia and beyond can be used for different tasks.\nI only noted down a few of the things they mentioned on the infrastructure side:\n\nOCEAN - a lanugage agnostic computing platform on AWS (docker)\nGit, Gitlab for version control and collaboration\nRstudio connect server\nSnakemake for orchestrate production\n\n\n\nR and Shiny\nThere are obvious benefits of using R. It is convenient to install and use (if you used python and R, you’d probably agree), and the latest development in Shiny made it very easy to develop interactive visualizations, suitable for exploration. Package development is critical for reproducibility and distributing works - which R does it very well. A few packages developed by pharma are Code and admiral: the ADaM in R, which I intend to check out at one point.\nR has deep roots in academia which means the newest statistical methods are well covered; which also affects the skill sets that talents own - fresh graduates probably already learned it at university. R being open source means that collaboration with external partners is much more efficient, and transparent. Strong community support is another positive thing that encourages beginners to enter the field and learn.\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sourcing Public Health\n\nSurveillance and reporting\nOne key functionality of public health (PH) authorities is stay informed and inform. They collect data from labs, hospitals and clinics across the country, summarize into useful statistics in tables and graphs, make reports, then inform the policy makers to make decisions (such as vaccination campaigns).\nCompared to clinical reporting (in my understanding), there are many similarities - we make TLG (tables, listings and graphs). There are also features that make reporting in public health unique:\n\nPH surveillance and reporting are dynamic and real-time, which can change in a matter of days. That is because the situation of different infectious diseases can evolve rapidly, so PH authorities need to make appropriate adjustments.\nTime and location (spatial-temporal) are important. Different time granularity (daily, weekly) and geographical units (nation, county, municipality, city districts) are typically required for reporting.\n\n\n\nScale up and automate with open source tools\nTraditionally, these reports are made manually - one location, one graph per time on a certain disease. When a global pandemic hits, this is definitely not fast enough. At my team (Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health), we tried a different approach. Details of what we did can be found in this talk(Code), but to make it brief:\n\nWe developed a fully automated pipeline that connects 15 registries (vaccination, lab, hospital and intensive care and many more). The data is gathered, censored, cleaned and pre-processed for down-stream analysis\nStatistical analysis, tables, graphs and maps are made for all locations in Norway for various outcomes of interest, such as Covid, influenza, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections\nOver 1000 customized reports with over 30 graphs and tables are produced daily and sent to local PH officials, where we also had a shiny website (Kommunehelsetjenester for Kommunelege) for over 300 PH officials to get most up-to-date information about their own municipality\n\nBy automation, every year Sykdomspulsen can save 700 000 NOK (roughly 70k USD) while making 400 times more real-time reports for public health. Even better, with reproducibility and quality control.\n\n\nToolbox\nSykdomspulsen is a small team (8 people, 3 are statisticians and 1 engineer), and our infrastructure was built upon R packages, which we call splverse. Our infrastructure is not fundamentally different from the one Roche introduced, basically:\n\nR does the task planning and project organization. On top of this, the data cleaning, statistical analysis are implemented. Graphs, tables and maps are made with appropriate R packages\nRmarkdown does automated reporting into .docx and .xlsx. Some reports are also in .html tables to be embedded into customized emails\nRstudio Workbench and GitHub help with teamwork\n\nDocker, GoCD and Airflow do the CI/CD and orchestration\n\n\n\n\nEmbrace the transition\n\nCulture change needed\nUnfortunately, not all organizations are eager to abandon the old way. Even at our own institute where researchers are the majority, open source and modern day programming is hardly practiced (by my observation). Even worse, under the budget cuts in 2023-24, a large number of younger employees who have the technical skills have left - which left the public health surveillance even more vulnerable now that Covid is far from over.\nIn my opinion, public health needs open-source and good programming even more than pharmaceutical companies. Both save lifes - and PH has less money to invest in softwares, infrastructures and talents. In this situation, resources should be spent in fields that are critical and most cost-effective; yet in reality this is often not the case.\nThe slow culture change at big organizations can happen, but only if there is a sufficient amount of employees who are willing to embrace the new technology. In the talk by Roche they about about their training strategy. It is not possible to train all users, and not everyone has the same needs at the same time. Therefore, self study with certain study paths is encouraged and supported.\n\n\nTeach programming to students in various fields\nBased on my experience in the UK and Norway, students (myself included) learn R programming in one of the two ways\n\nLearning by Googling (self-taught): a university degree needs to use it: provides a short introduction, then students learn by using. This is how I learned R at my MSc Statistics degree, and this is probably the most common way\nWorkshops at university: organizations such as the Carpentries provide course material and teaching a few times per year, where interested students (usually from subjects such as biology) come and learn. These classes are quite popular, and usually have a long waiting list.\n\nFrom learning by googling to some organized teaching - that is already some good progress. However, if not, can we improve?\nIn my experience with statistical advising with the university hospital, clinical researchers and medical students are enthusastic to get their statistics done, some are also eager to do some analysis themselves. That is good. Yet, there is generally lack of capacity - either knowledge or software skills. Once the statistician who helps with the project stops, the project ends. There is the need to have in-house statistical capacity. To this end, open-source softwares such as R, and good programming practice (reproducibility for example) can help a lot: the license doesn’t end, and everything is documented so that the next person can continue the work.\nI’m glad that my university has made some transitional efforts in this regard: STATA instead of SPSS is being taught to medical students as part of their statistics course. There might be a test-run in R soon, which is very exciting (since I’ll be involved in the teaching)!\n\n\nStatistical engineering and RSEs\nThat was the capacity building to get beginners more independent. On the other side, there is also the need for better programming practice for researchers at more advanced level. Research Software Engineering (RSE) is starting to get more and more attention, because it is not only relevant for research (i.e. getting papers published), but in broader applications.\nFor example, in the talk by Roche, they mentioned that “RSE teams need to accelerate adoption of new statistical methods and biomarker data analysis”, and the implementation with R packages and templates is at its core. In the future more languages would be included such as Python, Stan, C++ and Julia.\nHowever, RSE as a job title or career path is still a new thing. I know two RSEs at my university, and RSE is definitely not your typical academic faculty position: only departments that think it’s important makes positions, often not permanent. To get any new methods actually used in either industry or the public sector outside research, translating methods into tools is must-do. In the future I hope RSE becomes a stable and common career path, and more exciting things can happen."

Those who were the fastest learners were the ones who already had a degree in computer science, which probably doesn’t sound surprising. I, for one, definitely struggled."

You must have met clinicians or biologists who would love their data to be analysed yet don’t know how to. Yes, statistics and data skills can take some time to learn; but with the right method, they don’t have to be daunting. It is up to the educator to find a way that benefits the most students. An observation is that many researchers do not know or remember advanced math; yet do they need advanced math to grasp many fundamental statistical concepts?\nI believe that it is far more important and useful to teach basic IT skills and exploratory data analysis so that students can develop an understanding of their own data; rather than using a test blindly."

    "text": "Rebooting MF9130E classroom\nWhen I heard that the teaching team at Biostatistics Department, Faculty of Medicine was thinking about trying a novel pedagogical method on the MF9130E (2023 spring) class, I was more than excited to contribute. This is a PhD level course of 8 days long, offered three times a year (twice in Norwegian language). Students come from a variey of backgrounds in health and life sciences. Since this is an introductory course, the topics are broad rather than specialised.\nA few years ago, statistical software for the course made the transition from SPSS to Stata. To be more precise, students were introduced to, but not really explained to, or elaborated on how to use Stata proficiently. Why? The course is about statistics so only statistics is taught. Data skills such as manipulation are not part of statistics. \nWell, we will change that by starting to use R.\n\nThree open source musketeers\nR, quarto and GitHub the three musketeers in facilitating the transformation. We build a quarto course website where all the material are public, hosted with GitHub Pages. Having a course website is beneficial for students to have an overview of the course, in contrast to many scattered lecture notes and exercises to be downloaded.\nThe biggest advantage of using quarto is the rendered output from code. From a student’s perspective, it is reassuring to see the same result and plots using the data and code provided by the instructor. For the instructor, it is also convenient to see whether the code functions as expected. When we do not want to show the output, it is also very easy to suppress. We have created one copy with and one withtout rendered output as exercises, and are glad to see some students challenging themselves by attempting to solve the problems without solution.\nUsing Github and quarto together to build a course website is rather straightforward. I think the site structure is simple yet flexible enough to navigate. Collaboration across a small teaching team is also manageable. Github Pages was easy to set up, and changes made on the main branch is deployed within the minute. This proved to be useful in quite a few moments (where we had to replace some datasets or add some notice).\n\n\nThe Carpentries pedagogical model\nThe Carpentries is an organisation that teaches foundational coding and data science skills to researchers. I myself benefited from their workshop on version control and git taught at University of Oslo, and I think the traditional classroom could use some of the methods at these data science workshops.\nTo put simply, there are two things I tried with the course setup for MF9130E:\n\nLive coding demonstration, plenty of it\nSticky-notes flag and helper (teaching assistant) in class\n\nIn the live coding demonstration (which I was responsible for), I made sure that students were taught the most commonly used R commands for data manipulation and exploration. Quarto webpages on introduction to R, basic EDA, intermediate EDA have been created and guided through in class, mixed with statistical concepts and visualizations. Without knowing how your data looks like, blindly using statistical tests is dangerous - that is the motivation for doing so.\nWhether students feel supported can make a huge difference in their willingness to learn. Taking it slow at the beginning, and solve the problems on an individual basis can prevent early drop-outs, especially when programming and IT systems are involved. Naturally, when we don’t have helpers we can not help everyone; this is a limitation for this model. Students should be encouraged to help each other.\n\n\nLet them explore\nThe last important change in the class was to give time to students themselves. We reduced the lecturing on theory and computation, and added time for practice and discussion. The guided practice with live demo also came with solution and comments, so students could explore at their own pace. We left plenty of time for them to ask questions, and made sure most people can follow the exercises."

    "text": "How did it go?\nAfter the 8 day course we carried out a small survey among the ~50 students in the spring 2023 class. Student backgrounds are diverse, they work on lab data, clinical data or observational/epidemiological data:\n\nobservational study on humans 36%\nRCT 18%\nin vitro research 15%\nothers are in animal research, meta analysis or something else\n\nStatistical competency (method, software) among students are generally on the basic end. Over 75% of the cohort report themselves to have basic to very basic knowledge of statistics; 33% do not use any statistical software, around 45% have used SPSS or Stata. On the other hand, some students (7%) report to have advanced knowledge and have some R experience.\n\nSome feedback\nThis is the first time we do the course with R, live demo and put an emphasis on basic data manipulation and exploration - which means we do not have enough data, it is just an initial impression.\nHere’s what we have received. On the positive side, 86% find the course useful for their own PhD research. 75% felt they are able to use the correct methods for their analyses, which is quite encouraging. Most felt the examples and exercises were able to demonstrate the theory. Students have generally positive experience with the live demo, and find the instructors supportive. This is good!\nIn the meantime, it is only natural that some are dissatisfied (21%) in some ways. Common complaints are: R is not user friendly to absolute beginners; the leap from no software to a programming language is too big for some.\nAs for whether students have really mastered the knowledge intended, we do not have enough data to draw a conclusion. We do observe that the take home project show somewhat better understanding, but can not say for sure just yet.\nThis is a class with very diverse backgrounds, hence it is challenging to cater to everyone’s needs. Yet, we are satisfied with the trial-transformation with our introductory statistics class, and we plan to gradually implement more classes with R, and possibly hands-on practice (depending on capacity)."

Strictly speaking, webRand quarto are not R per se. However, they’ve become the gateway drugs for R programmers to dabble in WebDev. With web assembly (wasm), now one can execute R code in a browser and even run shiny app.\nUnlock the power of dataViz animation and interactivity in quarto by Deepsha Menghani used a super fun example (F-bomb) to demonstrate how to add interactivity to your barplot (or other plots) with Crosstalk. Check out the talk Code. The presentation was as interactive as the quarto slides, good job Deepsha!\nRunning shiny without a server by Joe Cheng (Code): this was a big announcement. I used shiny at work, but for my own projects or smaller teaching projects I tried to stay away from shiny - I was concerned about the fee. This looks like a promising thing to try out once it’s stable, although I’d probably do webR first."

Work on layout, color, font and sizes!\n\nThemes\nAdding a touch of glitr: Developing a package of themes on top of ggplot by Aaron Chafetz, Karishma Srikanth and colleagues at USAID. Code\n\n\nTables\nMaking tables with gt has been on my to-do list for a while now. It is very inspiring to see so many cool tables that makes you wonder, “is it really JUST a table?” For example, check out this gallery by Posit community.\nThe book Creating beautiful tables in R with gt by Albert Rapp would be a good place to learn how to make nice tables. Actually the reason why I wanted to use gt is that it seems to be the mainsteam in clinical reporting in pharma. I bumped into this blog post some time ago, and this would be my starting point.\n\n\nQuarto\nIf you want to go one step further and start making your quarto project pretty, there are a few things to try out.\nAlbert Rapp in his talk HTML and CSS for R Users stated that quarto is a gateway drug to WebDev. It reminds me of my very first presentation at my local R users community (2019) was about building a website with blogdown, and when I really spent a lot of time to make my markdown documentation colorful with span style - and that was about everything I knew.\nNow I want more. Learning HTML and CSS can make your dataviz, tables, slides and dashboards look not only professional but also special. I’m going to check out the scss variables in quarto which defines the theme, theme_file.scss. Emil Hvitfeldt (Styling and templating quarto documents) showed us how to make really pretty and animated (!) quarto sldies themes, and shared this template with us, quarto-revealjs-earth. I really like how revealjs slides look like, just that the MacOS Keynote (or MS ppt) drag-and-drop seems more flexible to me (?) Guess it’s something I should get used to over time.\nRichard Iannone (Extending quarto) introduced quarto shortcode extensions to add a bunch of fancy-looking icons to quarto files. To create extensions in general: https://quarto.org/docs/extensions/creating. This is for more pro-users since you needs to learn lua."

This culture in the 1980s and 90s was closely linked to the early open source software.\n“Bazaar”: highly participatory, versus “Cathedral”: restricted to a smaller group\nToday’s developer hardly even notice “open source” as a concept anymore, they just want to write and publish their code. They prioritize convenience over freedom or openness.\n\n\nOn licensing\nThe widespread use of permissive licensing is popularized by GH.\nCopyleft licensing (e.g. GNU General Public License GPL) is not commercial friendly as it requires companies to license their software that depend on open source GPL software to have the same license. However GPL gives developers more control over how others use their code in the long run.\n\nAs with any other online content today, sharing is the default.\n\n\n\n\nThe structure of an open source software\n\nOn how projects evolve\nCreate -&gt; Promote and distribute -&gt; Grow\nProjects are promoted like a founder would promote a startup: share on the relevant channels online, give talks at conference and meetups, encourage others to write and talk about it\nA sign that the software is used widely: when the maintainer starts doing more non-code (triage issues, review pull requests) rather than code work.\n\n\nContributor and users\nDepends on technical scope (whether there is much to do), support required (code and admin work), ease of participation (whether on Github) and user adoption (potential contributor base).\nFour types of projects\n\nhigh user growth, high contributor growth: federations. Rare, impactful, the ‘ideal’ of open source project. Roughly 3% of open source projects. Examples: Rust, Node.js, Linux\nhigh user growth, low contributor growth: stadiums: powered by one or a few developers. Centralized.\nlow user growth, high contributor growth: club. Similar to meetup or hobby groups, do not have a wide reach but are loved and built by enthusiasts.\nlow user growth, low contributor growth: toys. Personal project, isn’t trying to grow its user base. Projects on Github with less than 10 stars. Authors do not expect to receive contributions nor do they care about whether people are watching.\n\nDecentralized communities (clubs and federations) have the potential for high user growth - recruit new contributors, reduce contribution friction.\nCentralized communities (stadium) depends on the creators to manage user demand - automation, elimination of noise\n\n\n\nRoles, incentives and relationships\n\nFirms or communities\nFirms (companies, organizations): centralized resources; from a coordination standpoint, managing resources would be more efficient within the same organization - which does not explain why open source developers make software together without formal contracts and financial compensation.\n\n\nThe commons and peer production\nTragedy of the commons: resources depleted by people acting in their own self-interest rather than in the collective interest.\n(One of the 8 design principles by Ostrom on) successful commons:\n\nThose who are affecteed by the rules can participate in modifying them.\n\nStrong sense of group identity maks rules, dispute resolution more meaningful.\nCoordination cost is lower when self-organized based on who wants to do the work most, anyone can do the advertised work and volunteer.\nIn contrast, in companies - solicit, evaluate, hire, manage employees; only employees can do the work limited by their job functions.\nPeople collaborating online for no obvious reason beyond personal satisfaction (intrinsic motivation)\nModular and granular tasks: how tasks are organized, and how big each task is.\nLow coordination costs: quality control over thee modules, integrate the contributions into the finished product\n\n\nContribution beyond code\nSome users do not consider them a contributor, but do actually contribute by education, spreading the word, support (forum), bug reports and more.\nThese active users are similar to contributors but operate independently from project’s contributor community."
