    "section": "About the topic",
    "text": "About the topic\nThe 8 day introductory statistics course (MF9130) at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Oslo is designed for PhD students in medicine, biology, psychology and other health related fields. Similar to other conventional teaching methods, the course has been focusing largely on theory and hand calculation. The software has been Stata and SPSS, and data analysis was mostly left for the students to figure out on their own.\nThis year, we made an attempt to transform the course with R, and aimed to teach more practical data analysis skills. We added one session per day where the instructor guide students on R and project management, importing data , basic manipulation and statistical methods. The IT skills of the students vary greatly, and therefore we used the ‚Äòsticky notes‚Äô help system borrowed from the Carpentries to make sure everyone could get help in the first days. We have created a course website using Quarto, where all the material and R exercises (with rendered solution) are available for self-study. We have witnessed amazing progress - by the end of the first week, students with the least computer / data skills were able to work on dataframes, make basic plots and do a chi-squared test. This helps build students confidence in data and statistics, and as a result, they can start to work on their own datasets using the skills immediately."

However, making disease surveillance reports that cover different geographical units for various metrics and data registries is both resource intensive and time consuming. Open source tools such as R packages, GitHub and Airflow can make this process automatic, reproducible and scalable.\nEvery day during the pandemic, Sykdomspulsen team at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (FHI/NIPH) fetched data from more than 15 data sources, cleaned, censored datasets and carried out a wide range of statistical analyses. Over 1000 situational reports containing automated graphs and tables were produced before breakfast time.\nGrab you matpakke and join us for a presentation from Chi Zhang about how Sykdomspulsen team used and developed open source software to make public health surveillance and reporting more efficient, followed up by a discussion on the benefits and concerns of making these data public. We will end with an open Q&A session as usual!"

    "text": "Abstract\nWhile automatic performance metrics are crucial for machine learning of artificial human-like behaviour, the gold standard for evaluation remains human judgement. The subjective evaluation of artificial human-like behaviour in embodied conversational agents is however expensive and little is known about the quality of the data it returns. Two approaches to subjective evaluation can be largely distinguished, one relying on ratings, the other on pairwise comparisons. In this study we use co-speech gestures to compare the two against each other and answer questions about their appropriateness for evaluation of artificial behaviour. We consider their ability to rate quality, but also aspects pertaining to the effort of use and the time required to collect subjective data.We use crowd sourcing to rate the quality of co-speech gestures in avatars, assessing which method picks up more detail in subjective assessments. We compared gestures generated by three different machine learning models with various level of behavioural quality. We found that both approaches were able to rank the videos according to quality and that the ranking significantly correlated, showing that in terms of quality there is no preference of one method over the other. We also found that pairwise comparisons were slightly faster and came with improved inter-rater reliability, suggesting that for small-scale studies pairwise comparisons are to be favoured over ratings."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between a therapist and their client is one of the most critical determinants of successful therapy. The working alliance is a multifaceted concept capturing the collaborative aspect of the therapist-client relationship; a strong working alliance has been extensively linked to many positive therapeutic outcomes. Although therapy sessions are decidedly multimodal interactions, the language modality is of particular interest given its recognized relationship to similar dyadic concepts such as rapport, cooperation, and affiliation. Specifically, in this work we study language entrainment, which measures how much the therapist and client adapt toward each other‚Äôs use of language over time. Despite the growing body of work in this area, however, relatively few studies examine causal relationships between human behavior and these relationship metrics: does an individual‚Äôs perception of their partner affect how they speak, or does how they speak affect their perception? We explore these questions in this work through the use of structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, which allow for both multilevel and temporal modeling of the relationship between the quality of the therapist-client working alliance and the participants‚Äô language entrainment. In our first experiment, we demonstrate that these techniques perform well in comparison to other common machine learning models, with the added benefits of interpretability and causal analysis. In our second analysis, we interpret the learned models to examine the relationship between working alliance and language entrainment and address our exploratory research questions. The results reveal that a therapist‚Äôs language entrainment can have a significant impact on the client‚Äôs perception of the working alliance, and that the client‚Äôs language entrainment is a strong indicator of their perception of the working alliance. We discuss the implications of these results and consider several directions for future work in multimodality."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nBackground\nYouth with bipolar disorder (BD) are at high risk for suicidal thoughts and behaviors and frequently experience interpersonal impairment, which is a risk factor for suicide. Yet, no study to date has examined the longitudinal associations between relationship quality in family/peer domains and suicidal thoughts and behaviors among youth with BD. Thus, we investigated how between-person differences ‚Äì reflecting the average relationship quality across time ‚Äì and within-person changes, reflecting recent fluctuations in relationship quality, act as distal and/or proximal risk factors for suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempts.\n\n\nMethods\nWe used longitudinal data from the Course and Outcome of Bipolar Youth Study (N = 413). Relationship quality variables were decomposed into stable (i.e., average) and varying (i.e., recent) components and entered, along with major clinical covariates, into separate Bayesian multilevel models predicting SI and suicide attempt. We also examined how the relationship quality effects interacted with age and sex.\n\n\nResults\nPoorer average relationship quality with parents (Œ≤ = ‚àí.33, 95% Bayesian highest density interval (HDI) [‚àí0.54, ‚àí0.11]) or friends (Œ≤ = ‚àí.33, 95% HDI [‚àí0.55, ‚àí0.11]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI but not suicide attempt. Worsening recent relationship quality with parents (Œ≤ = ‚àí.10, 95% HDI [‚àí0.19, ‚àí0.03]) and, to a lesser extent, friends (Œ≤ = ‚àí.06, 95% HDI [‚àí0.15, 0.03]) was longitudinally associated with increased risk of SI, but only worsening recent relationship quality with parents was also associated with increased risk of suicide attempt (Œ≤ = ‚àí.15, 95% HDI [‚àí0.31, 0.01]). The effects of certain relationship quality variables were moderated by gender but not age.\n\n\nConclusions\nAmong youth with BD, having poorer average relationship quality with peers and/or parents represents a distal risk factor for SI but not suicide attempts. Additionally, worsening recent relationship quality with parents may be a time-sensitive indicator of increased risk for SI or suicide attempt."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe affective computing community has invested heavily in building automated tools for the analysis of facial behavior and the expression of emotion. These tools present a valuable, but largely untapped, opportunity for social scientists to perform observational analyses of nonverbal behavior at very large scale. Various tech companies are collecting huge corpora of images and videos from around the world that could be used to study important scientific questions. However, privacy restrictions and intellectual property concerns render these data inaccessible to most academics. Unfortunately, this limits the potential for scientific advancement and leads to the consolidation of data and opportunity into the hands of a few powerful institutions. In this paper, we ask whether similar psychological insights can be gained by analyzing smaller, public datasets that are more within reach for academic researchers. As a proof-of-concept for this idea, we gather, analyze, and release a corpus of public images and metadata and use it to replicate recent psychological findings about smiling, gender, and culture. In so doing, we provide evidence that psychological insights can indeed by democratized through the automated analysis of nonverbal behavior."

    "text": "Abstract\nMost work in automatic facial expression analysis seeks to detect discrete facial actions. Yet, the meaning and function of facial actions often depends in part on their intensity. We propose a part-based, sparse representation for automated measurement of continuous variation in AU intensity. We evaluated its effectiveness in two publically available databases, CK+ and the soon to be released Binghamton high-resolution spontaneous 3D dyadic facial expression database. The former consists of posed facial expressions and ordinal level intensity (absent, low, and high). The latter consists of spontaneous facial expression in response to diverse, well-validated emotion inductions, and 6 ordinal levels of AU intensity. In a preliminary test, we started from discrete emotion labels and ordinal-scale intensity annotation in the CK+ dataset. The algorithm achieved state-of-the-art performance. These preliminary results supported the utility of the part-based, sparse representation. Second, we applied the algorithm to the more demanding task of continuous AU intensity estimation in spontaneous facial behavior in the Binghamton database. Manual 6-point ordinal coding and continuous measurement were highly consistent. Visual analysis of the overlay of continuous measurement by the algorithm and manual ordinal coding strongly supported the representational power of the proposed method to smoothly interpolate across the full range of AU intensity."

Each session started with a semi-structured interview modeled on a typical ‚Äúclinical rounds‚Äù encounter and included administration of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS).\n\n\nAnalysis\nWe quantified aspects of participants‚Äô verbal behavior during the interview using lexical, coherence, and disfluency features. We then used two complementary approaches to explore our second objective. The first approach used predictive models to estimate participants‚Äô PANSS scores from their language features. Our second approach used inferential models to quantify the relationships between individual language features and symptom measures.\n\n\nResults\nOur predictive models showed promise but lacked sufficient data to achieve clinically useful accuracy. Our inferential models identified statistically significant relationships between numerous language features and symptom domains.\n\n\nConclusion\nOur interview recording procedures were well-tolerated and produced adequate data for transcription and analysis. The results of our inferential modeling suggest that automatic measurements of expressive language contain signals highly relevant to the assessment of psychosis. These findings establish the potential of measuring language during a clinical interview in a naturalistic setting and generate specific hypotheses that can be tested in future studies. This, in turn, will lead to more accurate modeling and better understanding of the relationships between expressive language and psychosis."

    "text": "Abstract\nFacial behavior is a valuable source of information about an individual‚Äôs feelings and intentions. However, many factors combine to influence and moderate facial behavior including personality, gender, context, and culture. Due to the high cost of traditional observational methods, the relationship between culture and facial behavior is not well-understood. In the current study, we explored the sociocultural factors that influence facial behavior using large-scale observational analyses. We developed and implemented an algorithm to automatically analyze the smiling of 866,726 participants across 31 different countries. We found that participants smiled more when from a country that is higher in individualism, has a lower population density, and has a long history of immigration diversity (i.e., historical heterogeneity). Our findings provide the first evidence that historical heterogeneity predicts actual smiling behavior. Furthermore, they converge with previous findings using selfreport methods. Taken together, these findings support the theory that historical heterogeneity explains, and may even contribute to the development of, permissive cultural display rules that encourage the open expression of emotion."

    "text": "Abstract\nBy systematically varying the number of subjects and the number of frames per subject, we explored the influence of training set size on appearance and shape-based approaches to facial action unit (AU) detection. Digital video and expert coding of spontaneous facial activity from 80 subjects (over 350,000 frames) were used to train and test support vector machine classifiers. Appearance features were shape-normalized SIFT descriptors and shape features were 66 facial landmarks. Ten-fold cross-validation was used in all evaluations. Number of subjects and number of frames per subject differentially affected appearance and shape-based classifiers. For appearance features, which are high-dimensional, increasing the number of training subjects from 8 to 64 incrementally improved performance, regardless of the number of frames taken from each subject (ranging from 450 through 3600). In contrast, for shape features, increases in the number of training subjects and frames were associated with mixed results. In summary, maximal performance was attained using appearance features from large numbers of subjects with as few as 450 frames per subject. These findings suggest that variation in the number of subjects rather than number of frames per subject yields most efficient performance."

    "text": "Abstract\nFacial expression is central to human experience. Its efficiency and valid measurement are challenges that automated facial image analysis seeks to address. Most publically available databases are limited to 2D static images or video of posed facial behavior. Because posed and un-posed (aka ‚Äúspontaneous‚Äù) facial expressions differ along several dimensions including complexity and timing, well-annotated video of un-posed facial behavior is needed. Moreover, because the face is a three-dimensional deformable object, 2D video may be insufficient, and therefore 3D video archives are required. We present a newly developed 3D video database of spontaneous facial expressions in a diverse group of young adults. Well-validated emotion inductions were used to elicit expressions of emotion and paralinguistic communication. Frame-level ground-truth for facial actions was obtained using the Facial Action Coding System. Facial features were tracked in both 2D and 3D domains. To the best of our knowledge, this new database is the first of its kind for the public. The work promotes the exploration of 3D spatiotemporal features in subtle facial expression, better understanding of the relation between pose and motion dynamics in facial action units, and deeper understanding of naturally occurring facial action."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nImplementing a computerized facial expression analysis system for automatic coding requires that a threshold for the system‚Äôs classifier outputs be selected. However, there are many potential ways to select a threshold. How do different criteria and metrics compare? Manually FACS coded video of 45 clinical interviews (Spectrum dataset) were processed using person-specific active appearance models (AAM). Support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were trained using an independent dataset (RU-FACS). Spectrum sessions were randomly assigned to training (n=32) and testing sets (n=13). Six different threshold selection criteria were compared for automatic AU coding. Three major findings emerged: 1) Thresholds that attempt to balance the confusion matrix (using kappa, \\(F_1\\), or MCC) performed significantly better on all metrics than thresholds that select arbitrary error or accuracy rates (such as TPR, FPR, or EER). 2) AU detection scores for kappa, \\(F_1\\), and MCC were highly intercorrelated; accuracy was uncorrelated with the others. And 3) Kappa, MCC, and \\(F_1\\) were all positively correlated with base rate. They increased with increases in AU base rates. Accuracy, by contrast, showed the opposite pattern. It was strongly negatively correlated with base rate. These findings suggest that better automatic coding can be obtained by using threshold-selection criteria that balance the confusion matrix and benefit from increased AU base rates in the training data."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nThe high penetration of Renewable Energy Sources (RES) into the grid introduces complexity to the operation and optimization of energy. One potential solution to the challenge is to use deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based techniques to regulate voltage and reactive power under dynamic conditions. However, there is a need to optimize the DRL for better performance and robustness. This paper proposes a Bayesian optimization (BO) technique within the DRL framework to improve the performance and robustness of volt-var control (VVC) in power distribution systems. We combine the actor-critic DRL algorithm with the BO framework to yield fast optimal volt-var control policies. We use BO techniques to estimate DRL-based VVC decisions and accelerate model-training convergence. In the case study, we demonstrated that the BO in DRL on IEEE-13 has improved decision-making by 21.11% and 81.81% for 123 bus test systems. Our research shows that Bayesian-enabled DRL adapts to different grid configurations and maintains voltage profiles within desired limits, thereby improving DRL control policies."

DRL is a potential solution to optimize power system operations, but it requires significant time and resources during training. The control policies developed using DRL are specific to a single grid and require retraining from scratch for other grids. Training the DRL model from scratch is computationally expensive. This paper proposes a novel TL with a DRL framework to optimize VV C across different grids. This framework significantly reduces training time and improves VVC control performance by fine-tuning pre-trained DRL models for various grids. We developed a policy reuse classifier that transfers the knowledge from the IEEE-123 Bus system to the IEEE-13 Bus system. We performed an impact analysis to determine the effectiveness of TL. Our results show that TL improves the VVC control policy by 69.51 %, achieves faster convergence, and reduces the training time by 98.14%."

While forecasting methods estimate future values from historical data, traditional approaches often struggle with computational efficiency and model complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting model that integrates multi- variate estimation (MVE) and pure prediction (TSP) using a bidirectional long-short-term memory network (Bi- LSTM) optimized with Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)- based Bayesian optimization. The model incorporates numerical weather prediction (NWP) data for real-time forecasting, a key limitation in existing methods. MVE utilizes features such as wind speed, direction, temperature, and pressure, while TSP captures historical power generation patterns. The TPE-optimized Bi-LSTM architecture effectively captures bidirectional temporal dependencies, improving in both short-term and long-term forecasting. The model is evaluated using a six-year historical wind energy dataset from NREL, with performance assessed through RMSE, MAE, and R2 score. It outperforms traditional LSTM variants (Vanilla LSTM, Stacked LSTM, Bi-LSTM) and state-of-the-art models such as Transformers and GRUs, achieving R¬≤ scores of 0.976 for MVE and 0.932, 0.928, and 0.864 for TSP across short-term, day- ahead, and long-term forecasting, respectively. Additionally, TPE based Bayesian optimization reduces computational time around 8-10%, enhancing hyperparameter tuning efficiency. The study further analyzes the model‚Äôs computational burden, scalability, and practical implementation, offering a robust and efficient approach for improving wind power forecasting accuracy. \n\n\nMethod\n(\\(N_{ASD}=23\\), \\(N_{NT}=52\\))\n\n\nResults\n\n\nConclusions"

    "text": "Abstract\nThe relationship between nonverbal behavior and severity of depression was investigated by following depressed participants over the course of treatment and video recording a series of clinical interviews. Facial expressions and head pose were analyzed from video using manual and automatic systems. Both systems were highly consistent for FACS action units (AUs) and showed similar effects for change over time in depression severity. When symptom severity was high, participants made fewer affiliative facial expressions (AUs 12 and 15) and more non-affiliative facial expressions (AU 14). Participants also exhibited diminished head motion (i.e., amplitude and velocity) when symptom severity was high. These results are consistent with the Social Withdrawal hypothesis: that depressed individuals use nonverbal behavior to maintain or increase interpersonal distance. As individuals recover, they send more signals indicating a willingness to affiliate. The finding that automatic facial expression analysis was both consistent with manual coding and revealed the same pattern of findings suggests that automatic facial expression analysis may be ready to relieve the burden of manual coding in behavioral and clinical science."

    "text": "Abstract\nBoth the occurrence and intensity of facial expressions are critical to what the face reveals. While much progress has been made towards the automatic detection of facial expression occurrence, controversy exists about how to estimate expression intensity. The most straight-forward approach is to train multiclass or regression models using intensity ground truth. However, collecting intensity ground truth is even more time consuming and expensive than collecting binary ground truth. As a shortcut, some researchers have proposed using the decision values of binary-trained maximum margin classifiers as a proxy for expression intensity. We provide empirical evidence that this heuristic is flawed in practice as well as in theory. Unfortunately, there are no shortcuts when it comes to estimating smile intensity: researchers must take the time to collect and train on intensity ground truth. However, if they do so, high reliability with expert human coders can be achieved. Intensity-trained multiclass and regression models outperformed binary-trained classifier decision values on smile intensity estimation across multiple databases and methods for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. Multiclass models even outperformed binary‚Äìtrained classifiers on smile occurrence detection."

Sixteen psychiatric diagnoses and five transdiagnostic dimensions were examined in relation to self-reported interpersonal problems. The structural summary method was used with the Inventory of Interpersonal Problems Circumplex Scales to examine interpersonal problem profiles for each diagnosis and dimension. We built a structural model of mental disorders including factors corresponding to detachment (avoidant personality, social phobia, major depression), internalizing (dependent personality, borderline personality, panic disorder, posttraumatic stress, major depression), disinhibition (antisocial personality, drug dependence, alcohol dependence, borderline personality), dominance (histrionic personality, narcissistic personality, paranoid personality), and compulsivity (obsessive-compulsive personality). All dimensions showed good interpersonal prototypicality (e.g., detachment was defined by a socially avoidant/nonassertive interpersonal profile) except for internalizing, which was diffusely associated with elevated interpersonal distress. The findings for individual disorders were largely consistent with the dimension that each disorder loaded on, with the exception of the internalizing and dominance disorders, which were interpersonally heterogeneous. These results replicate previous findings and provide novel insights into social dysfunction in psychopathology by wedding the power of hierarchical (i.e., dimensional) modeling and interpersonal circumplex assessment."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe Duchenne smile hypothesis is that smiles that include eye constriction (AU6) are the product of genuine positive emotion, whereas smiles that do not are either falsified or related to negative emotion. This hypothesis has become very influential and is often used in scientific and applied settings to justify the inference that a smile is either true or false. However, empirical support for this hypothesis has been equivocal and some researchers have proposed that, rather than being a reliable indicator of positive emotion, AU6 may just be an artifact produced by intense smiles. Initial support for this proposal has been found when comparing smiles related to genuine and feigned positive emotion; however, it has not yet been examined when comparing smiles related to genuine positive and negative emotion. The current study addressed this gap in the literature by examining spontaneous smiles from 136 participants during the elicitation of amusement, embarrassment, fear, and pain (from the BP4D+ dataset). Bayesian multilevel regression models were used to quantify the associations between AU6 and self-reported amusement while controlling for smile intensity. Models were estimated to infer amusement from AU6 and to explain the intensity of AU6 using amusement. In both cases, controlling for smile intensity substantially reduced the hypothesized association, whereas the effect of smile intensity itself was quite large and reliable. These results provide further evidence that the Duchenne smile is likely an artifact of smile intensity rather than a reliable and unique indicator of genuine positive emotion."

Consistent with our hypotheses, admiration was distinctly related to generally agentic (i.e., dominant) interpersonal processes, whereas rivalry generally reflected (low) communal (i.e., hostile) interpersonal processes. Furthermore, NARQ-admiration and NARQ-rivalry related to generally adaptive and maladaptive aspects of status-related constructs, emotional, personality, and social adjustment, respectively.

    "text": "Abstract\nEmotional expressiveness captures the extent to which a person tends to outwardly display their emotions through behavior. Due to the close relationship between emotional expressiveness and behavioral health, as well as the crucial role that it plays in social interaction, the ability to automatically predict emotional expressiveness stands to spur advances in science, medicine, and industry. In this paper, we explore three related research questions. First, how well can emotional expressiveness be predicted from visual,linguistic, and multimodal behavioral signals? Second, how important is each behavioral modality to the prediction of emotional expressiveness? Third, which behavioral signals are reliably related to emotional expressiveness? To answer these questions, we add highly reliable transcripts and human ratings of perceived emotional expressiveness to an existing video database and use this data to train, validate, and test predictive models. Our best model shows promising predictive performance on this dataset (RMSE=0.65,R2=0.45,r=0.74). Multimodal models tend to perform best overall, and models trained on the linguistic modality tend to outperform models trained on the visual modality. Finally,examination of our interpretable models‚Äô coefficients reveals a number of visual and linguistic behavioral signals‚Äîsuch as facial action unit intensity, overall word count, and use of words related to social processes‚Äîthat reliably predict emotional expressiveness."

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nAs with many other racial and ethnic minorities, Hispanic Americans face substantial disparities in health care access and disease prevalence. The published literature on mental health disorders among Hispanic individuals, however, is not robust, and their experience of depressive disorders remains poorly understood. The construct of acculturation may help elucidate the risk of depression among Hispanic Americans and may inform the development of appropriate policy and treatment resources. We examined the degree to which acculturation may interact with key demographic variables (sex, age, socioeconomic status [SES], and Mexican ancestry) in accounting for depressive symptomatology among Hispanic Americans. We conducted a series of Bayesian generalized linear mixed models using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to investigate the self-reported depressive symptomatology (measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire‚àí9) of Mexican Americans and other Hispanic individuals and to examine possible effects of acculturation and demographics on depressive symptomatology in this population. Mexican Americans had substantially lower levels of depression than other Hispanic individuals. Acculturation was positively associated with depression severity, but this effect was moderated by sex and SES. High acculturation was more strongly linked to depression among men and those of high SES. Acculturation and several demographic factors were associated with depressive symptomatology among Hispanic individuals. Acculturation can be useful in understanding risk, developing culturally informed interventions, and implementing community-level changes to address the burden of Hispanic depression."

    "text": "Abstract\nDimensional conceptualizations of psychopathology hold promise for understanding the high rates of comorbidity with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Linking PTSD symptoms to transdiagnostic dimensions of psychopathology may enable researchers and clinicians to understand the patterns and breadth of behavioral sequelae following traumatic experiences that may be shared with other psychiatric disorders. To explore this premise, we recruited a trauma-exposed online community sample \\((N = 462)\\) and measured dimensional transdiagnostic traits of psychopathology using parceled facets derived from the Personality Inventory for DSM-5 Faceted‚ÄìShort Form. PTSD symptom factors were measured using the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 and derived using confirmatory factor analysis according to the seven-factor hybrid model (i.e., Intrusions, Avoidance, Negative Affect, Anhedonia, Externalizing Behaviors, Anxious Arousal, And Dysphoric Arousal). We observed hypothesized associations between PTSD factors and transdiagnostic traits indicating that some transdiagnostic dimensions were associated with nearly all PTSD symptom factors (e.g., emotional lability: rmean = .35), whereas others showed more unique relationships (e.g., hostility‚ÄìExternalizing Behavior: \\(r = .60\\); hostility with other PTSD factors: \\(r = .12‚Äì.31\\)). All PTSD factors were correlated with traits beyond those that would appear to be construct-relevant, suggesting the possibility of indirect associations that should be explicated in future research. The results indicate the breadth of trait-like consequences associated with PTSD symptom exacerbation, with implications for case conceptualization and treatment planning. Although PTSD is not a personality disorder, the findings indicate that increased PTSD factor severity is moderately associated with different patterns of trait-like disruptions in many areas of functioning."

    "text": "Abstract\nThe field of Automatic Facial Expression Analysis has grown rapidly in recent years. However, despite progress in new approaches as well as benchmarking efforts, most evaluations still focus on either posed expressions, near-frontal recordings, or both. This makes it hard to tell how existing expression recognition approaches perform under conditions where faces appear in a wide range of poses (or camera views), displaying ecologically valid expressions. The main obstacle for assessing this is the availability of suitable data, and the challenge proposed here addresses this limitation. The FG 2017 Facial Expression Recognition and Analysis challenge (FERA 2017) extends FERA 2015 to the estimation of Action Units occurrence and intensity under different camera views. In this paper we present the third challenge in automatic recognition of facial expressions, to be held in conjunction with the 12th IEEE conference on Face and Gesture Recognition, May 2017, in Washington, United States. Two sub-challenges are defined: the detection of AU occurrence, and the estimation of AU intensity. In this work we outline the evaluation protocol, the data used, and the results of a baseline method for both sub-challenges."

    "text": "2024.7.8-11, Salzburg, Austria. Conference link: UseR!\nStatisticians using multiple softwares (SAS, R, Python) will have found differences in analysis results that warrant further justification. Whilst some industries may accept results not being the same as long as they are ‚Äúclose‚Äù, the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry would require an identical match in results. Yet, discrepancies might still occur, and knowing the reasons (different methods, options, algorithms etc) is critical to the modern statistician and subsequent regulatory submissions.\nIn this talk I will introduce CAMIS: Comparing Analysis Method Implementations in Software. https://psiaims.github.io/CAMIS/ It is a joint-project between PHUSE, the R Validation Hub, PSI AIMS, R consortium and openstatsware. The aim of CAMIS is to investigate and document differences and similarities between different statistical softwares such as SAS and R. We use Quarto and Github to document methods, algorithms and comparisons between softwares through small case studies, and all articles are contributed by the community. In the transition from proprietary to open source technology in the industry, CAMIS can serve as a guidebook to navigate this process.\n\nkeywords: cross industry collaboration, multi-lingua, open-source, quarto"

    "text": "Real-World Data (RWD) like Electronic Health Records (EHR) is crucial for understanding drug usage and various treatments and generating Real-World Evidence (RWE). Risk prediction has been a major application where EHR is used, and there is now a shift towards causal inference, which requires data of even higher quality. Patients undergo treatments (drugs, procedures) at various times during their hospital stays, yet the data being recorded are messy and error-prone for various reasons. Analysts spend significant amount of time to sit together with clinicians to identify and understand abnormal records, and unfortunately this process is challenging to automate.\nThis talk will use an example on antibiotics prescription and use at a Nordic hospital to illustrate how some EHR systems can improve for better clinical decision-making and better data for research. I will also introduce a pilot R package (ggehr) that facilitates visual exploration of EHR data, and how it can help reconstruct patient journeys and enable analysts to perform effective quality control."

    "text": "About the topic\nThe Department of Biostatistics at University of Oslo offer statistics courses at different levels for medical students and PhD candidates with clinical backgrounds. The courses were traditionally taught with a focus on theory instead of data analysis, where SPSS and STATA were the tools of choice.\nSince 2023 spring semester, we have been gradually transforming some of our statistics courses into R, using Quarto course websites and Carpentries style live-coding instruction. With new Quarto tools (such as WebR) we also added interactivity in the code blocks. So far we have transformed two courses with over 100 students who have almost no programming experience. We have observed impressive progress in the skill development, and received significantly more positive feedback when it comes to statistics education.\nIn this talk, I would like to share our experience on the successes and challenges throughout the process. Looking back, is it cost-effective? Definitely. Can we do better in the future? Almost surely. If you are also planning to adopt new technology in your teaching activities, join us to learn more about what you can do to make the transition happen!\nCourse website can be accessed here"
