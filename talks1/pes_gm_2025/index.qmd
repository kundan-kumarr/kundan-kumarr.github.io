## Introduction

As renewable energy integration accelerates, modern power grids face mounting complexity in maintaining stability and efficiency. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has emerged as a powerful technique for **Volt-Var Control (VVC)** — regulating voltage levels across the distribution grid — but its Achilles’ heel lies in **expensive retraining**.  
Every new grid topology or environment demands retraining from scratch, costing time, data, and computational energy.

In our latest work, presented at the *Workshop on Autonomous Energy Systems (GRID-EDGE 2025)*, we introduce a **Transfer Learning (TL)-based DRL framework** that enables policy reuse across different grid configurations — cutting training time by *98.14%* while improving performance by *69.51%*.

## Core Idea: Transfer Learning Meets DRL

Traditional DRL systems learn from scratch. TL-DRL systems, however, **transfer policy knowledge** from a source grid (e.g., IEEE-123 Bus) to a target grid (e.g., IEEE-13 Bus).

This approach allows agents to **start smarter**, building upon previously learned representations rather than reinventing them. The heart of this system is a **policy reuse classifier**, a small neural network that decides when the previously learned policy should be reused or adapted.

---

## How It Works

The framework operates in three phases:

### 1. **Source Training**
A DRL agent, using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, learns to manage the IEEE-123 Bus system. The policy parameters, denoted as θₛₒᵤᵣcₑ, optimize voltage levels and reactive power flow according to ANSI C84.1-2020 voltage standards.

### 2. **Policy Reuse Classifier**
We train a binary classifier that predicts the probability of reusing a learned policy:
\[
P(\text{Reuse}|\text{Observation}) = \sigma(f_\text{classifier}(\text{Observation}))
\]
If this probability exceeds 0.5, the source policy is transferred directly; otherwise, the agent retrains in the target environment.

### 3. **Target Adaptation**
The target model (θₜₐᵣgₑₜ) adapts to the IEEE-13 Bus through **fine-tuning and Q-value updates**, balancing exploration and exploitation dynamically:
\[
\epsilon = P(\text{Reuse}|\text{Observation})
\]
This adaptive mechanism allows the agent to decide when to trust previous experience and when to explore new strategies.

## Experimental Setup

We implemented the system in **OpenDSS** using the **PowerGym** RL environment.  
The source policy (IEEE-123 Bus) was trained for 20,000 iterations, taking 313 seconds.  
The TL-enhanced target model (IEEE-13 Bus) adapted in just **9.6 seconds** — compared to **518 seconds** when trained from scratch.

| Metric | Training with TL | Without TL |
|---------|------------------|-------------|
| Mean Reward | -8.310 | -27.256 |
| Training Time | 9.62 s | 518.38 s |
| T-Statistic | 102.93 | — |
| P-Value | 6.38 | — |
| TAS (Task Adaptation Score) | 72.78 | — |
| Embedding Distance (ED) | 31.11 | — |

These results show that TL not only speeds up convergence but also produces a **statistically significant performance improvement**.

## Key Insights

1. **Efficiency Leap** — TL cut training time by 98%, accelerating grid simulation workflows dramatically.  
2. **Policy Robustness** — The classifier effectively distinguished when to reuse policies, preserving stability in unseen grid configurations.  
3. **Scalability** — The approach generalizes across systems of different complexity, paving the way for large-scale adaptive control.

## Broader Impact

The proposed **TL-DRL framework** makes reinforcement learning practical for real-world grid management.  
By leveraging existing knowledge, utilities can deploy **smarter and faster control policies**, reducing both **operational costs** and **computational footprints** — a critical step toward **sustainable AI-driven power systems**.

---

## What’s Next

Our next goal is to **scale TL across multiple grid sizes** — from micro-grids to regional networks — and to integrate **physics-informed constraints** that further improve generalization.  
We also aim to extend this framework to **federated and collaborative learning** paradigms, allowing distributed grids to share intelligence securely.

## About the talk

We developed a TL-DRL framework, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:A2C}, which involves transferring policy knowledge from one distribution grid to another. Additionally, we have created a policy reuse classifier to determine whether to transfer the policy knowledge from the IEEE-123 Bus to the IEEE-13 Bus system and conducted an impact analysis.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ppo_objective}
\theta_{\text{source}} = \arg \max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t - \beta \text{CLIP}(\theta) \right]
\end{equation}
The $\theta_{\text{source}}$ is trained with the DRL algorithm on the IEEE-123 Bus, which regulates the VVC voltage profiles within permissible limits.

While $\theta_{\text{target}}$ is the model which transferred the knowledge $\theta_{\text{source}}$ and adapts well in the $\theta_{\text{target}}$  domain.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:target_theta}
\theta_{\text{target}} =
\begin{cases}
 \begin{aligned}
 \theta_{\text{source}}\; & \text{if } P(\text{Reuse}|\text{Observation}) > 0.5 
 \end{aligned} \\
 \arg \max_{\theta} \mathbb{E}_{\tau \sim \pi_{\theta}} \left[ \sum_{t=0}^{T} \gamma^t r_t \right] & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
