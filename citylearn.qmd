The **LLM-Powered Energy Optimizer** integrates **Large Language Models (LLMs)** with the **CityLearn** multi-building energy environment to achieve **adaptive energy coordination and optimization**.  
By combining the reasoning ability of LLMs with reinforcement-based control agents, this framework demonstrates how **language-driven guidance** can enhance **decision-making and interpretability** in smart energy systems.

###  System Overview
The project leverages **CityLearn**, an open-source urban energy simulator, where multiple buildings interact with shared energy resources such as batteries, HVAC systems, and renewable units.  
The LLM acts as a **high-level advisor**, generating structured reasoning steps, policy explanations, and optimization prompts to assist the RL controller in selecting efficient energy actions.

### Core Components
- **CityLearn Environment:** Multi-building coordination for energy storage and HVAC scheduling  
- **LLM Agent Layer:** Generates task explanations, reasoning chains, and adaptive control advice  
- **Reinforcement Learning Backbone:** PPO and SAC algorithms for optimizing power and comfort metrics  
- **Physics-Informed Feedback:** Embeds voltage, power, and thermal constraints into decision flow  

---

### Objectives
- Reduce total energy consumption and carbon footprint  
- Improve system interpretability through LLM reasoning chains  
- Enable human-in-the-loop adjustments using natural-language instructions  

---

### Research Impact
This work bridges the gap between **natural-language intelligence** and **energy optimization**, enabling explainable, sustainable, and **LLM-guided adaptive control** in modern smart cities.
